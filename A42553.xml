            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Have not we cauſe to think, that the Lord hath a great controverſie with our Nation, which is ſo full of malicious controverſies and contentions, to the diſhonour of God, who is Love; of his Goſpel, which
<pb facs="tcp:38435:5"/> is a Doctrine of Love and Peace; and of that ancient Law and Meſſage of Love, which he ſent unto us from heaven in the beginning, and hath ſo often renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince the beginning. If we look upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> rents and breaches, diſcords, diviſions, quarrels, contentions that are between men, and that many tim s about triffles; if we conſider with what eagerneſs, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obſtinacy, theſe are followed; might it not ſeem, that there had never been a Doctrine of Love and Goſpel of peace preached among us? They that are full of carnal mirth, care for none of theſe things, as it was ſaid of <hi>Gallio.</hi> It is one ſpecial part of our obedience to the Law of Love, that we ſhould with much compaſſion m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urn for theſe things, that if it be poſſible, the wrath that is like to fall upon the Land, may be prevented; and withall let us mourn for the danger of many particular Souls, who live without any ſpark of Chriſtian Love to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Brethren, without which they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly periſh: and let us pray for them that their ſins may be forgiven them, and that their hearts may be purified in obeying the truth through Faith, unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Love of the Brethren.</p>
            <p>Satan is an enemy to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Love, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the neereſt and faſteſt union: he is a moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit and Murtherer, and loveth to break the union of the Spirit, and the bond of peace betwixt man and man. Therefore the neerer any are united and joyned together in any bond of Love, the more doth he labour to make a rent and diviſion between them.
<pb facs="tcp:38435:6"/> So he delighteth to rent the Church of Chriſt, and to ſeparate one member of it from another by Hereſie and Schiſm, to breed difference in judgment, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eupon diviſion of hearts between thoſe that are the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>feſſed members of one myſtical body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>How were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> knit together in Love, and how did they joyn together as one Soul in the work of the Lord, whereunto they were ſeparated by the Spirit from the reſt of the faithful, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the holy Story? yet upon a ſlight occaſion, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan bred a ſharp contention between them, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration between theſe two holy men for a time. So it is his delight to break the neareſt and ſtrongeſt bonds, even the matrimonal tye betwixt man and wife, which are one fleſh: between Brethren and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that are of one blood: between the Inhabitants of one Kingdom, one City, one Houſe.</p>
            <p>That which cannot endure heat, can leaſt of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the greateſt heat. Ice that is apt to diſſolve at a little warmth, can leſs endure heat in the higheſt degree: bring it to the fire, and it ſoon diſſolveth. So the Devil, that hateth Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, doth moſt of all hate, and work againſt the greateſt, neereſt, and ſtrongeſt union.</p>
            <p>So long as the Saints are not yet fully fitted and framed together, no wonder though there be differences between them. As ſtones, ſo far as they are fitted together, they joyn and cloſe in one; but if they be but yet in fitting and framing, and the work be but done in part, not in perfection; they will not cloſe in
<pb facs="tcp:38435:6"/> every point. So when Chriſtians are but in part fitly framed together in Chriſt, they do but in part cloſe and unite, and there may be differences, until that which is perfect is come, and that which is but in part be done away; for ſo far as they are not fitly joined together in Chriſt, ſo far they are yet carnal, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>1 Cor. 3.1.3.</hi> And thus he accounteth them, while envying, ſtrife, and diviſions are among them. We muſt conſider that they agree in the main, as they meet in one Foundation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone, and are fitly framed together in Chriſt. So in the main they agree in one mind, and are of one heart. They hold the foundation; they meet in one common Center which is Chriſt, though they differ ſomewhat in drawing their Lines. The true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, though there may be ſome diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between ſome of them and others, yet they all meet in their Head, and receive one life and ſpirit from Him.</p>
            <p>And whereas (I ſay) they agree in the main, you muſt know.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That in reſpect of the Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> they agee in all thoſe Truths, which are ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, though they differ ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times about ſome of the conſequents of theſe, or about ſomething of leſs moment; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth in <hi>1 Cor. 3.</hi> that theſe which hold the foundation of <hi>Faith,</hi> may build diverſly: ſome Gold, Silver, precious Stones: Some Hay, Straw, Stubble.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> They all partake of the ſame main neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:38435:7"/> fundamental Graces, Faith unfeigned, Hope, Love, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though ſome in a greater, ſome in a leſſer meaſure. Some have more Droſs mixed with their Graces than others. The Corruptions of men are therefore ſo much the more to be lamented herein, that thoſe who agree in ſubſtance, ſhould not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but alſo quarrel and fall out about Circumſtances, joyn in the foundation, and rent in the frame.</p>
            <p>It was a worthy ſpeech of <hi>Grynaeus,</hi> an Orthodox Divine, who having ſome intercourſe of Letters with <hi>Chytraeus,</hi> though ſeeming to differ from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sacrament; he told him in one of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to this effect, That though they ſhould not ſee each others faces here in this world, yet he hoped they ſhould meet in heaven, <hi>Ubi Luthero cum Zuinglio optimè convenit,</hi> where <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> agree exceeding well. They that are ſo fitly framed together in Chriſt, as that they are ſet in a way and ſtate, which ſhall lead them to a full and perfect agreement in heaven, which is one common Home and Countrey appointed for them all, ſhould bear in mind <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s admonition to his Brethren, when he ſent them home to their Fathers houſe, <hi>Fall not out by the way, Gen. 45.24.</hi> When we come to our Fathers houſe in Heaven, there ſhall be no jarrs, not one croſs word paſs between us, not an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry look or thought to all eternity. Therefore in our paſſage thither we ſhould be careful to walk peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and if in all things we cannot be of one mind (which yet we ſhould endeavour by all means) yet
<pb facs="tcp:38435:7"/> ſhould we bear with others in a patient and peaceable manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Much honoured in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſign of this Treatiſe (which I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to you) is, to provoke men (and eſpecially the Saints) to that Love of one another, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature moſt ſtrives againſt, turning all chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aſide (as it were) into a private Channel of ſelf-love, which like the Sea, ſhould diſperſe it ſelf throughout the whole World.</p>
            <p>It was a famous Proverb in the primitives times, which now reflecteth infamy upon our times, <hi>Ecce, ut ſe invicem diligunt Chriſtiani,</hi> See how the Chriſtians love one another! Then fierce conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hatred among Chriſtians, declared men to be no Chriſtians at all; and can it now conſiſt with any new ſtamp of Chriſtianity?</p>
            <p>Religion is the ſureſt Cement of all Societies, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deareth them one to another in ſpecial ſort, it hath it's Name of binding men to God,<note place="margin">Religio a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando.</note> and man to man. But alas! many there are that think Religion to be no ſuch eye as we pretend; nay they begin to queſtion whether there be any ſuch thing as Religion, or no. We have even loſt Religion in queſtions about Religion, been diſputing ſo long which is the true, that almoſt we are come to have none at all. The world turns A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:38435:8"/> were not the cauſe of it. The Oratour ſaid of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that whoſoever went to take that from men, went about to take away the Sun out of Heaven; of Religion we may ſay ſo indeed, They that would rob us of that, would rob us of our Sun; this were a way to diſſolve the Brotherhood between <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> God grant that we may be all as the Angels of the Mercy-ſeat, that turned face to face, and not back to back, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes, that made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſpoyl and waſt where they went.</p>
            <p>I dare not preſs too far on your patience, but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech, that you will be pleaſed to command him, who ſtudieth how he may ſhew himſelf,</p>

                  <p>SAint <hi>John</hi> had this Eminence of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs above the reſt of Chriſt's Diſciples, That <hi>he was the beloved Diſciple.</hi> And, as it is ſaid of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in Heaven, That he lyeth in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, ſo our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had this Heaven on Earth, To lean on Chriſts Boſom: Who drew ſuch love from Chriſt, that he became the Apoſtle of Love. The main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this Epiſtle, is, This Grace of <hi>Love:</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:38435:12"/> Firſt, He largely ſets forth God s Love to us: <hi>God is Love,</hi> and Chriſt is Love; he found it ſo, when he lay in the Boſom of Chriſt. Then mainly, he exhorts us to <hi>mutual-love;</hi> Shewing, How Saints ſhould live together like Brethren, and love another. It is no new command that he lays upon them, but that which they had heard before, <hi>that they ſhould love one another.</hi> The words of the Text, are the firſt Reaſon or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to confirm the Truth of the former Propoſition; ſhewing, that one main Property of the Children of God, is laid down here in this verſe, where we may note

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> lyeth in this, That <hi>God hath commanded this duty of Mutual-love towards each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Now thoſe that are of God, <hi>have his law written upon their hearts,</hi> which are framed to obey him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Circumſtances</hi> are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That this Commandment is ſent as a meſſage from heaven to earth, from God to man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is an ancient meſſage, it is from the beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How it is ſaid, <hi>to be from the beginning,</hi> ſeemeth ſomewhat doubtful. There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38435:12"/> interpretations of this word <hi>[beginning.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some underſtand it from the beginning of the publiſhing of the Law in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Ancients by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in an open and ſolemn manner, which is a Law of <hi>Love,</hi> and commandeth us, <hi>to love our Neighbours as our ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others underſtand it from the beginning of Chriſt's preaching of the Goſpel, and the Apoſtles immediately after him, This being the great commandment that Chriſt laid upon his Diſciples, <hi>A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, Joh.</hi> 13.34. And again, that which the Apoſtles laid upon all the Saints: Some underſtand it, from the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Goſpel unto theſe Chriſtians, to whom the Apoſtle here writeth. But</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the Beginning may be underſtood from the creation of Man. The law of nature ſtampt upon mens hearts in the firſt creation, dictateth to us, that we ought to love one another. There may be ſome reaſon given, to prove this ſenſe to be very probable; for in the next words, this reaſon is amplified, by an example of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſin, <hi>Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and ſlew his brother,</hi> &amp;c. So that it may ſeem, that as he alleadgeth a contrary Example, whereby this commandment of Love was fearfully bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſo he may have this meaning, That the commandment of Love, which was tranſgreſſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38435:13"/> by <hi>Cain</hi> near the beginning of the world (he being the firſt man that ever was born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) was delivered in the beginning of the world, before this tranſgreſſion of <hi>Cain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected, that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith to theſe Chriſtians to whom he writeth, <hi>ye have heard it from the beginning:</hi> How could thoſe that then lived hear this in the beginning of the world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It may be underſtood thus, That the Apoſtle may (as it were) comprehend the whole body of Mankind together, that lived in ſeveral ages, and ſo that which thoſe that lived in the beginning, heard for their, own uſe, and the uſe of all Mankind, may be ſaid to be ſpoken to all from the beginning. Or thus — Ye have heard it from the beginning, that is, Ye have heard it as an ancient meſſage delivered in the beginning, and not as a new meſſage or commandment. Howſoever, it is true every way. This Law of Love was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the beginning of the world: It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered alſo in the beginning of that open and ſolemn publication of the Law in Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> it was delivered in the beginning of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel after our Saviour's coming in the fleſh, <hi>That we ſhould love one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Love</hi> I ſhall ſpeak all along this Treatiſe: We are here to enquire what is meant, by <hi>one another.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38435:13"/>1. Some by <hi>[one another]</hi> include the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; but the Scripture uſually ſets forth the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Love by two terms</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By Brother is uſually meant the Saints, who are all born of God, therefore Brethren. Godly men are ſaid to be Brethren</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Adoption, God hath adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all to be his children, they have one Father who hath begotten them, they have all the ſpirit of Adoption given to them, <hi>whereby they cry Abba,</hi> Father: that is, <hi>Father, Father.</hi> It is doubled, to ſhew, that God is our Father, both by Creation, and by Adoption. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints are brethren to Chriſt; <hi>He is not aſhamed to call them brethren,</hi> Heb. 2.12. <hi>Go tell my brethren, and ſay unto them,</hi> &amp;c. The reaſon is given in the meſſage, <hi>I aſcend unto my father, and your father, and to my God, and your God.</hi> Words as full of comfort, as the ſea of Water, or the Sun of Light. [My brethren] What a loving compellation is this, to hear Chriſt call a poor creature, <hi>my brother?</hi> O bleſſed Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a moſt happy Correlation!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard of their participation of one and the ſame divine nature: all ſaints have the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38435:14"/> ſame image of God upon them, as the ſame image of the King is ſtampt upon all his coyn: every one of them are alike in holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; hence they <hi>mutually love one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of their Communion of the ſame priviledges: They are all elected of God the Father, redeemed by Chriſt; they are all Temples of the Holy Ghoſt: they are all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Covenant: they are all reconciled: they all have grace: they are all Veſſels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Every one (as <hi>Solomon</hi>) is a <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> the beloved of the Lord himſelf: God loveth them all alike in Chriſt. What priviledg hath <hi>David</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a converted <hi>Gentile; John the beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> above a converted Publican, in point of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sonſhip?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of Participation of one and the ſame Inheritance: Heaven is every particular ſaints eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;<note place="margin">Magna bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentia, cum unicus ſit, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men noluit eſſe unicus.</note> and God is every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſaint's eternal reward. Though Chriſt be the ſole Heir of Heaven and Earth, yet he would not be the ſole Heir, but will have all his brethren to be partakers of the ſame Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>They are joynt-heirs with Chriſt:</hi> He maketh them all Kings to reign with him in glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are called Brethren, to ſhew, how ſaints ought to carry themſelves each to other, even as brothers do, and ought to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38435:14"/> love as brethren. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8, 9. to converſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to accompany each other, to counſel one another for their mutual good, and to perform all offices of love and kindneſs to each other. It is an excellent ſaying of <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> If the ſpiritual man be in us, our Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is Fraternity; what then is our Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? It is raiſed to that which hath no name to expreſs it: The union of the ſaints in Heaven, is beyond the union of Fraternity. This which is of Grace is of the ſame nature.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe we have a command to love our ſelves, in that the Lord commandeth us, to love

That I love a child of God, I may be certain of it; but that I am beloved of others is uncertain. <hi>Judas</hi> was a Diſciple in ſhew, but a Devil in heart.

               <p>FRom the former Circumſtance in this text, note this point of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. <hi>That the Commandment of love, is a meſſage ſent from heaven to earth, from God to man:</hi> Which is to be underſtood of the whole word of God, and eſpecially of the Doctrine of <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>brotherly-love,</hi> between men and men. Sin ſet man againſt God, and God againſt man. God ſent a meſſage of Love and Reconciliation unto man, between himſelf and man in his Goſpel, offering peace and love to man by his Son: on the other ſide ſin made a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man: God ſent a meſſage of Love from heaven alſo unto men, that thoſe breaches ſhould be made up, and that they ſhould joyn together in an holy and <hi>brotherly-love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God's Miniſters are Meſſengers, ſent of God with a meſſage of love, with a meſſage, offering love from God to man, and requiring Love from man to God; and on the other hand, requiring Love between man and man: ſo the name of the Apoſtles ſignifieth men ſent on a meſſage. Chriſt being aſcended up into heaven, ſent them about the world with a meſſage of Love, offering Love, and commanding Love: Theſe Meſſengers of Chriſt found the world
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38435:16"/> fighting agrinſt God, and to be hateful, and hating one another, and ſo delivered a meſſage of Love unto them from God.</p>
               <p>Now as in other meſſages, ſo in this, ye may ſee

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perſon</hi> who ſent this meſſage, is the great God, who being full of glory and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, accompanied with ſo many thouſands of glorious Angels, who were knit together in Love to him, and to each other; among whom was not the leaſt jarr, nor any thing that was offenſive to any of them: He (I ſay) pitied the miſery of Mankind, whom he ſaw full of rents and diviſions, tormented with malice and rage againſt each other, vexing themſelves and others; and ſo out of his love and compaſſion ſent this meſſage unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Meſſengers by whom it was ſent, they have been diverſe in ſeveral ages: firſt the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Flood: Ye read of <hi>Enoch</hi>'s prophecy mentioned by St. <hi>Jude,</hi> who was the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> and was before the Flood. Ye find <hi>Noah</hi> a preacher of righteouſneſs before the Flood, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> noteth: and <hi>Lamech</hi> the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38435:17"/> Father of <hi>Noah</hi> (not he that was of <hi>Cains</hi> poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) ſeemeth to have had the ſpirit of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> &amp; to have revealed the <hi>Lords</hi> Counſel communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him unto the Church; and therefore he gave a ſignificant name to his Son, calling him <hi>Noah,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Reſt,</hi> becauſe he ſhould give them <hi>reſt</hi> from the toyl of their hands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the earth which the Lord hath curſed.

So I am perſwaded, that the Lord did by <hi>Adam</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy men, reveal his counſel, and ſend meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the world, according to his will.</p>
               <p>After the Flood, there were <hi>Shem, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. then <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets in ſeveral ages: and in ſpecial, <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was ſent as a peculiar Meſſenger before the face of Chriſt. Then came Chriſt Jeſus, who was the principal Meſſenger, and Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

                  </gap> he was God, and one of the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, ſo he did ſend this meſſage: as he took upon him, the the office of a Mediator and Meſſenger between God and man, ſo he was ſent of this meſſage, and came preaching Love among men. Then were his Apoſtles ſent out by him unto all the world, to deliver a meſſage of Love from him unto them; after them, Paſtors and Teachers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38435:17"/> to the end of the world. Of theſe Meſſengers, ſome had this meſſage from God, immediately revealed to them by his Spirit, as the <hi>Patriachs, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were immediately inſpired: ſome (as it were) at the ſecond hand, as the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's coming; and <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> ſince: who underſtanding the mind of the Lord by his word, do deliver his meſſage to the world: yet ſo, that even theſe alſo (as many of them as are faithful) have the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more or leſs, opening the Myſteries and Counſels of God unto them, and enabling them to deliver his meſſage unto his people.</p>

               <p>Thou wilt ſay perhaps, that he hath given thee cauſe to hate him: oh then remember that God hath ſent thee a meſſage, that thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to love him: Can the wrongs that he hath done thee, diſcharge thee of that obedience which thou oweſt to the Lord's meſſage and commandment? Can any enemy give thee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe to diſobey the Lord's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? None can free a man from owing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38435:18"/> to the lawful commands of lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: but ſome higher Authority, the Supream and higheſt Authority, commandeth thee to love thy Brethren, Neighbours, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, all whomſoever, though not all in the ſame degree. Now the wrongs of any of theſe can by no means diſcharge thee from that bond of Love, which the Authority of God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon thee.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to rule the tongue or hands, and to abſtain from open wrongs in word or deed, and in the mean time, to carry a bitter Spirit in our breaſts againſt others: Nay it is not enough to carry our affections upon terms of indifferency and neutrality, ſo as neither to love nor hate, as ſome men may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and think they do well enough, if they do not hate them, though they do not love them. As <hi>Balak</hi> ſaid to <hi>Balaam</hi> concerning the Iſraelites, <hi>neither bleſs them at all, nor curſe them at all;</hi> ſith he could not perſwade him to <hi>curſe</hi> them, he would fain have had him not to <hi>bleſs</hi> them, but to carry himſelf indifferently betwixt him and them; ſo many men, becauſe they are forbidden malice and revenge, do think they do well, if they abſtain from theſe, albeit they bear no love to their Neighbour in their hearts, eſpecially if he be one that hath wronged them. But this is not enough, the Lord hath ſent thee a meſſage that thou ſhouldſt love thy

Oh then, labour to get the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love and Power, and of a ſound mind, to frame thy heart to love others, becauſe thou findeſt, that God hath loved thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to love thy Brethren, and thine enemies; then thou wilt not think how ill ſuch and ſuch perſons have deſerved thy love.</p>

               <p n="2">II. INaſmuch as the Lord hath ſent a meſſage of love unto men, this ſheweth, That they are contrary unto God, who carry meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages between men, that tend to the overthrow of love, and breeding of ill-will and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice between men and men.

               <p>All that live under the Goſpel, profeſs one Faith, partake of one Baptiſm, eat and drink all at one Table of the Lord, &amp;c.

               <p>HAving conſidered the firſt Circumſtance, I come to the ſecond, which ſheweth the Antiquity of this Doctrine of Love: it was <hi>from the beginning:</hi> whence I obſerve.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the Commandment of Love is from the <hi>beginning.</hi> It is true, we do not find, that it was in expreſs words given in command at the beginning of the world: I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38435:20"/> mean, we do not find any Record in the Word mentioning any ſuch expreſs Command of Love delivered in the beginning; but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſuch a command was giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n; for otherwiſe, <hi>Cain</hi> had not been guilty, when he did ſo notoriouſly tranſgreſs the Law of Love, in hating and murthering his Brother; for where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion. But it is manifeſt, that <hi>Cain</hi> did grievouſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as appeareth, by the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, by his arraignment and puniſhment of him; therefore there was a Law of Love gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the beginning; againſt which this man, that was the firſt man born of a woman, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grievouſly; and for which he was ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Now it is out of Queſtion, That it was written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart before his Fall; for it was a ſpecial part of that holy Image of God in him.— But then it may be ſaid, that this Image of God was loſt by the Fall, and ſo the Law of Love, as well as other parts of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was blotted out of his heart.— I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that though it were blotted out of his heart, yet I do not believe it was blotted out of his head and underſtanding, but that ſtill he retained a knowledg of this duty, although his heart was now ſo corrupted, and his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo perverted and diſordered, that he could not frame his heart to obey this Law of Love:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38435:20"/> He had loſt that inclination to entire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love, which he had by Creation, and by which he reſembled God, who is Love. But howſoever, the writing the Law in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> at his Creation, or the remaining of this Law in the mind and underſtanding of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> I conceive not to be meant here by this meſſage of God ſent to men, and requiring them to love each other; for that was not <hi>lex tradita, ſed inſculpta,</hi> not a Law delivered by way of meſſage, but a Law engraven, and a Character of Love imprinted in the mind of <hi>Adam:</hi> But this ſpoken of here, is the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Law, as a meſſage ſent from God to man.</p>
               <p>Therefore I conceive, That this Law of Love was by the Spirit of God revealed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and to other holy men, who were ſtirred up of God to teach and deliver it unto men, and to propagate this Doctrine of <hi>Brotherly-love,</hi> as men multiplied and encreaſed upon the earth. So it appeareth, in that ſoon after the the Fall; the Doctrine of the Goſpel and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt, was delivered to <hi>Adam,</hi> as a gracious meſſage of Life. Now this was the Doctrine of Faith, and the Doctrine of Faith and Love are inſeparable, and always go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Graces of Faith and Love are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways joyned. For in Chriſt, who is promiſed in the Goſpel, not only God is reconciled to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38435:21"/> man, but alſo man is knit to man in Love. So ye may ſee how theſe two are joyned together as it were in one commandment, 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we believe in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another as he gave us commandment.</hi> So that the Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel commanding Faith, is but an imperfect Law, if it be not joyned with the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Love.</p>
               <p>The commandment of Faith and Love toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make up a compleat Law: Therefore I doubt not, but as the one, ſo the other alſo was delivered in the Beginning. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew this well, who lived long before the Law was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and therefore he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Love, and laboured to cheriſh Love, and to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Ancient Laws are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, and ought eſpecially to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and obſerved. That Law of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies delivered to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was a new Law in compariſon of this, and therefore it was no fundamental Law of the Church of God, and ſo it was abrogated in the fulneſs of time; but this Law of Love is both an ancient Law from the beginning, and ſo a fundamental Law of the Church of God, without which the Church cannot ſtand; for if Love be taken away, there can be no Church. Therefore men do little conſider what they do, when they allow themſelves in the neglect of Chriſtian-Love, and in the duties thereof. They ſin againſt a moſt ancient and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law, without which the Church of God cannot ſtand. Malice, Hatred, want of Love, is a ſin againſt the foundation of Obedience and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>As there be fundamental Errors, <hi>viz.</hi> Errors againſt the foundation of Faith, ſo there be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38435:22"/> (as it were) fundamental ſins, ſins againſt the fundamental Law of Love. Every failing in the duties of Love is a ſin againſt this Law; but the want of Chriſtian-Love, and the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of Malice and Enmity in the heart, are more directly againſt this ancient and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law. This Law of Love, then being an ancient and fundamental Law, delivered from the beginning, doth commend unto us the excellency of Chriſtian and Brotherly-Love, and ſhew the odiouſneſs of the contrary ſin. None can reſt upon Chriſt, the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Corner-Stone of the Church, which hath not this fundamental Law of Love writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, which hath not his heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Love. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Tongues of men and Angels, faith to remove mountains, abundance of knoledg;</hi> all theſe, if a man had them without Love, cannot profit: no, though a man ſhould give all his goods alſo to the poor, and his body to the fire; and why? Becauſe he wanteth a fundamental and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Grace, required in this fundamental and ancient Law; the want whereof proveth him not to be grounded nor built upon Chriſt, the Foundation and Corner-Stone of the Church, becauſe he hath not the Spirit of Love which is in Chriſt. How ſhould this move every one of us then, to ſearch our hearts diligently, leſt any Lees or Dregs of Malice ſhould ſettle there,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38435:22"/> 
                  <hi>leſt</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>any root of bitterneſs ſhould remain there, and ſpring up in us.</hi> How ſhould it move us, to purge out all affections contrary unto Love.</p>

               <p n="2">II SEeing this Commandment of Love was from the beginning, it ſhould teach us, That no injuries which men have done, or can do againſt us, ſhould make us think our ſelves diſcharged from the duty of Love towards them. This Law of Love, pleadeth preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt all ſuch wrongs and injuries what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. It was before them, and it is to take take place before them, and againſt them all. The Law of Love which is ſo ancient, even from the beginning, ſhould cauſe us to walk in Love, and to do the offices of Love, above all thoſe new injuries which men have done us, or may do us. Theſe ſhould not prevail ſo to draw us to Malice and Hatred, or to extinguiſh Love in us, as that ſhould to beget and encreaſe Love.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle diſputing about the Law and the Goſpel in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> ſaith, That the Law, as it was publiſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> being four hundred years after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38435:23"/> of the Goſpel given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> could not diſanul that Promiſe, and make it of none effect: much leſs can any injuries diſanul this law of Love, which is many thouſand years more ancient than any injury which we have received: therefore ſtill this ancient Law ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in force, and bindeth us to love even thoſe who do moſt of all wrong and provoke us. Is it not then a moſt unchriſtian thing, when men cannot lay down old enmities, nor purge out old grudges, nor forgive old injuries? Are any ſo old as this moſt ancient law of Love, which is from the beginning? There is a wicked he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary enmity between ſome Families and Kinreds, which deſcendeth from father to ſon, &amp;c. and they will not give it over, becauſe it is ſo ancient: What if it were Five hundred years old? yet this law of Love, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Five thouſand years old, ſince the delivery of it to Mankind, ſhould prevail ſo far with us, as to make us forget them, and to walk in Love.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Antiquity of this law of Love, ſhould cauſe us to conſider of that great Day of the Lord, which ſhall be in the end of Time, even at the end of the world; when all the breaches of this law (not being blotted out by repentance) that have been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are now, and ſhall be to the end of the world, ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38435:23"/> Oh the innumerable Tranſgreſſions againſt this law in all ages, which then ſhall be called to account, and brought to the Barr of the higheſt Tribunal, even before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Chriſt! Oh the horrible murthers, maſſacres, cruelties, oppreſſions, extortions, thefts, rapes, perſecutions, tyrannies of Princes and States, malitious plots and practiſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious courſes, wrongs, injuries; and (among the reſt) thoſe bloody Wars, and deſtroying of Nations with fire and ſword; which, if they be not lawfully undertaken, and lawfully man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, are to be accounted among the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious breaches of this royal and moſt ancient Law: and beſide theſe, all fraudulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt dealings; together with other things of like nature.</p>
               <p>What mighty numbers of notorious Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſhall then be arraigned and endited for the breach of this ancient Law, which was from the beginning? What numberleſs Catalogues, and huge Bills of Offences againſt this Law, ſhall then be brought to Tryal? The thought of this, might make mens hearts to ſhake, and their knees to ſmite together, as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s did: If we conſider, That as he ſaw an hand miraculouſly writing his Doom upon the wall; ſo the hand of God hath written, and doth write all theſe Offences in the Tables of men's Conſciences, where they ſhall ſtand recorded

               <p>How ſhould we bewail the fearful Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions againſt this moſt ancient and ſacred Law, committed now among our ſelves, to whom the Goſpel of Love and Peace is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in which Goſpel, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, hath eſpecially, as in his laſt Teſtament bequeathed Peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Love unto us; I ſay in this Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſealed with his own moſt precious blood, which he ſhed in Love towards us, to make Peace between God and us, That ſo we might be at peace among our ſelves.</p>

THat it is the meſſage and ſolemn charge of God and Chriſt, That Chriſtians ſhould love one another.</hi> It is not an Arbitrary thing, <hi>That we ſhould love one another,</hi> but the Command of God; a great Command, and that which is joyned <hi>to believing in his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. The one is as truly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation as the other. Let men talk of Believing (while they will) on the Son of God; yet if they have no Love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Their Faith is a dead Faith; becauſe God ſtands much upon this, To have his people live together in Love: At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the verſe he ſaith, <hi>it is his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and at the end of the verſe he ſaith, <hi>he gave us Commandment.</hi> It is alſo obſervable, that he ſaith of the Commandment of Love, <hi>he gave us that Commandment:</hi> It is a gift; we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38435:25"/> ſhould not only ſubmit to it, as being bound by the Authority of it; but we ſhould open our hearts to it, and cheerfully embrace it, as a Gift from God.</p>
                  <p>Love is an affection of the Heart, ariſing out of an Apprehenſion of God's Love to us, and embracing others in the Lord, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.11. <hi>If God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love another.</hi> He ſheweth, whence this ſpiritual love ſpringeth, even from an Apprehenſion of God's Love to us. Now from this Love to God, ariſeth our Love to others. <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. <hi>If a man ſay, he loveth God, and hateth his brother, he is a Lyar;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>This Commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his brother alſo.</hi> So that, as our Love to God ariſeth from God's Love to us; ſo this ſpiritual Love to men ariſeth, both from God's Love to us, and our Love to God. And it is in the Lord: True ſpiritual Love, carrieth a reſpect to God, and not ſo much to outward things. It loveth others, either with reſpect to God's Graces in them, or with reſpect to God's Command; either, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath put his likeneſs upon them; or becauſe God hath commanded them to love them. In the former reſpect, this Love em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the Godly: in the ſecond, All men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath commanded us to love all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of our Neighbour: For that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Saviour to the queſtion, (Who is my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38435:25"/> Neighbour?) is appliable to any. And Chriſt, who ſpeaketh peremptorily, <hi>[I ſay unto you, Love your enemies]</hi> excludeth none.</p>
                  <p>Now that this Love is ſound, only in the ſanctified Soul, is eaſily proved by the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf; for it ariſeth from an apprehenſion of God's Love to us. Now whereſoever this is rightly apprehended, there is ſome degree of Sanctification, and the heart is in ſome meaſure purified. For God's Love is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a ſound Faith, and a ſound Faith puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the heart: Yea the Love of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth ſo far, as to brin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere are two remarkable things, about this: Chriſt calleth it <hi>a new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and he calleth it <hi>his Commandment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He calleth it <hi>a new Commandment</hi> for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is given after a <hi>new</hi> manner. The Law commandeth us <hi>to love our Neighbour as our ſelves.</hi> Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e our Love to our ſelves, is the Rule of our Love to our Neighbour. But Chriſt in his Goſpel commandeth us <hi>to love one another, ſicut ego dilexi vos, as I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you,</hi> ſaith he: We muſt Love each other even as he hath loved us. Where Chriſt's Love to us muſt be the Rule and Meaſure of our Love to the Saints, and to all men.</p>
                  <p>The Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> Chriſt extends it further, and ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy very Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Love muſt be, like the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhineth upon the Good and the Bad. Our Love (like the Clouds) muſt drop on the barren Heath, as well as upon the rich and fruitful Soyl. <hi>We muſt do good to them that do us evil, bleſs them that curſe us.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:38435:26"/>2. It is called <hi>new</hi> in reſpect of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this Grace, and ſo it is an <hi>Hebraiſm:</hi> It was the <hi>Hebrew</hi> cuſtom to call excellent things, <hi>new: quia nova, aut ſunt, aut videntur meliora quàm vetera;</hi> becauſe <hi>new</hi> things, either are, or ſeem to be better than old. As if our Saviour had ſaid, Many a Commandment have I delivered unto you, but this is inſtead of all; <hi>Love one another.</hi> Love will make you to keep all the other. Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is called <hi>new,</hi> as <hi>Maldonat</hi> thinketh, not becauſe it is a <hi>new</hi> command, or delivered in a <hi>new</hi> manner, but becauſe our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth this above all, and commandeth and preſſeth it to his Diſciples, as if it were a new command brought from heaven; as if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of ſuch Truth before, <hi>Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Novitas reſpicit ſtudium diligendi, non man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is called a new Commandment, as the Goſpel is called a new Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe it muſt be renued every day; We muſt love, and yet moreover we muſt pay this this debt of Love continually, and yet ſtill ſtand in debt.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt calleth it his Command for two reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:38435:27"/>1. Becauſe among all the Commands of the Moral Law, he preſſeth this moſt of all; As if he had ſaid, <hi>Moſes</hi> from God commandeth you many things, I command this, <hi>Love ye one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:</hi> This is the Royal Law, which ye muſt obey.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe he is moſt delighted in it: It is the joy of Chriſt, when he ſeeth Brethren to dwell together in Love and Unity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>It is like the precious Oyntment of Aaron;</hi> How ſweet was that? It is like the Dew of <hi>Hermon;</hi> How fruitful is that? For there the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth his Bleſſing, even Life for evermore. Eternal Life is the Crown; the Reward, the bleſſing of Brotherly Love: How pleaſant, how comly is that?</p>
                  <p>This is one of thoſe weightier things of the Law, which our Saviour ſpeaks of <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. Yea, the weight of the Law lieth upon it, as it were: For the Law is fulfilled by Love; not excluding Faith, but preſuppoſing it. This is the order, firſt Faith, ſecondly Love to God, thirdly Love to man. Faith apprehendeth God's Love to us in Chriſt, God's Love apprehended by Faith, makes us love God: Our Love to God maketh us to love our Neighbour. And where this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not framed in the Heart and Soul, there is no right orderly frame of Holineſs; but meer diſorder and confuſion. There may be ſome confuſed motions now and then, towards
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38435:27"/> heavenly things, and ſome diſordered purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to lead a new life; but there is not Chriſt formed in the heart, nor holineſs framed there, nor Kingdom of Chriſt ſet up there; nor I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God imprinted there; nor the Law of God written there.</p>

               <p>IN the proſecution of this point, I will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle theſe four Concluſions: 1. I ſhall ſhew, That we muſt love all men. 2. That Godly men muſt love even the wicked. 3. That Godly men muſt love even their very Enemies. 4. That the Godly muſt eſpecially love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we muſt love all men.</p>
               <p>Here firſt, Let us obſerve theſe Differences of Love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a Love of Pity and Compaſſion. This Love is due to all men, good and bad who are in miſery. This will make thee weep with them that weep, not ſhedding the tears of a Crocodile, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Nethani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.6. But rather of our Saviour, who not only raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but alſo wept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, to make it appear how he loved him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.35. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid, <hi>Oh how be loved
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38435:28"/> him!</hi> He that is a man of much natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be kindly affectioned with Brotherly-Love, for where there is no Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, there can be no true love either of Man or of God.</p>
               <p>True Love to any is manifeſted, chiefly to their Souls. Doſt thou ſee men to go on in ſin, and in a deſperate neglect, not to regard the Salvation of their own Souls; then mourn for them, being moved with the conſideration, into what miſery theſe wretched Creatures are like to plunge themſelves in. Seeſt thou a vain Senſualiſt ſpend his days in the eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of carnal delights, never conſidering his latter end, mourn for his Sorrows hereafter. Seeſt thou a Neighbour drunk, or heareſt thy Friend ſwear and curſe, let thy heart pity him. Alas poor Soul! What will he do when Chriſt cometh to judgment? Poor wretch! methinks I ſee him weeping and wailing, and wringing his hands, although now he ſpend his days in mirth and jollity. This Love was in Chriſt towards the wicked Jews, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41. For even in his Triumph, when the people was making great joy, he then wept over <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> This was the burden of his Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>O Jeruſalem, that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace; but now they are hidden from thine eyes.</hi> O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, thou that now triumpheſt, I cannot but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38435:28"/> weep, when I conſider how the things of thy peace are going, and thy fearful deſtruction is hanging over thee; the ſword of God's ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is drawn out againſt; thee. So when thou ſeeſt any wicked man, merry and jovial, pity him, O poor wretch! Thou that art ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now, O that thou kneweſt the things that belong unto thy peace, before they be hid from thee: I do even ſee how the ſword of Divine Wrath hangeth over thine head, and thy Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſlumbereth not.</p>
               <p>This Love of Compaſſion was in <hi>David, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of tears</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>run down mine eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men keep not thy Law.</hi> I mourn when I ſee wicked men to be jolly in their ſins. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There are ſome of whom I tell you weeping, that are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. There is a Love of mercy and help, due to all in their Afflictions. This is plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the parable of the good Samaritan. The wounded man was not his Companion; he found him in miſery by chance as he was paſſing by the way-ſide, whether he were Jew, or Gentile, or Stranger, this Samaritan did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, relieve him, and took great care to recover him. See what uſe our Saviour made of this, <hi>Go, do thou likewiſe the ſame.</hi> Doſt thou ſee a man in miſery, be not like the Prieſt, and the mercileſs Levite, but be a good Samaritan
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38435:29"/> to him, ſpeak comfortably to him; and let thy heart joyn with thy tongue, and thy hand with thy heart; be as ready to do good, as to wiſh well to him, that he may bleſs God in thee, and for thee. If thou canſt not do all thou wouldſt, yet be willing to do all thou canſt, and where thou canſt do no more, turn thy wiſhes into prayers; and from prayer conclude for thoſe that are Godly, <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in Glory by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe a wicked man is in miſery, and it is in thy power to help him; yet give ſomething <hi>humanitati,</hi> if not <hi>homini.</hi> The Sun ſhineth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good and the bad; the Clouds water both, the Creatures tell thee what thou ſhouldſt do. A good man (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) is merciful to his beaſt; then much more, will a good man be merciful to a man in miſery. In the Law God ordained, that if a man did ſee his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mies Oxe or Aſſe in a ditch or pit, he ſhould help him out. Doth God take care for Oxen and for Aſſes, and not much more for men? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>Dives</hi> is tormented in Hell for his hard-heartedneſs towards diſtreſſed <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The Love of Courteſie and Gentleneſs. We owe Kindneſs and Gentleneſs to all men; This is a Fruit of the Spirit. A ſurly, dogged, harſh temper is unbeſeeming a Chriſtian: ſuch perſons are more fit to be Monks and Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38435:29"/> than Chriſtians. God himſelf is ſaid to be a God of a great Kindneſs; ſo muſt his children be. A gentle Spirit puts forth it ſelf to all gentle and curteous behaviour; drawing affection and delight from others. See how ſweetly our Saviour carried himſelf towards all. When the man came in, not having the Wedding-garment, <hi>Friend,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> It is Parabolical indeed, but yet our Saviour ſheweth, with what gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, courteſie and kindneſs, he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Some there are indeed that turn Love into Complements, and affected Phraſes and Geſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; that will make great Proteſtations of Love and Kindneſs, <hi>when their heart is not with you, Prov.</hi> 23.7. Such a one will ſay, he is your ſervant, at your command, he will kiſs your hand, or the hemm of your Garment, but it is with the kiſs of a <hi>Joab</hi> or a <hi>Judas;</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth two Faces under one Hood: but the true Chriſtian is little in Circumſtances, but ſtriveth to abound in the Subſtance of Love. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> contended together in weeping, not in crying <hi>[Your Servant Sir]</hi> in real friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not in empty words. It cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſome Ceremonies, that is, outward Expreſſion in the very Geſtures and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces of Friends will thruſt in with true Love; not ſo much for Love-ſake, as for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38435:30"/> the witneſs and acknowledgment of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, which is the Ground, Nurſe and Guardian of Love: Therefore Love makes no difference between affected Complements, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right rudeneſs, but ſhunneth both alike, that it may neither waſt Complements, nor neglect that reſpect which Civility, Modeſty and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion require, as a part of the debt of Love. But to be a Maſter of the Art of Ceremonies (as one ſaith) and to aſſert ſuch a neceſſity of them, as to exceed in their uſe; as it favoureth not of a ſimple ſincere ingenuous Spirit, ſo it ſets the Teeth of true Love on edg: The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's main care ſhould be to love, not in word or tongue, but in deed and in truth.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There is the Love of Familiarity and Friendſhip. This we owe not to all, but to the Saints. As the School-men ſay of God, There is <hi>Amor in Deo, erga omnes, non amicitia,</hi> God loveth all, but God ſaith not to every one, You are my Friends, but only to the Godly. In this reſpect he ſaith, <hi>Eſau have I hated, Jacob have I loved; Jacob</hi> is my Friend, whom I love with my ſpecial Love. So there may be in the Godly, Love to the wicked, but not Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Familiarity. The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Walk not with the frowa d, for thou thy ſelf-ſhalt learn frowardneſs;</hi> Wicked men will defile the Godly, by intimate and conſtant Communion. <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt not marry with <hi>Aſhdod;</hi> no <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:38435:30"/> or <hi>Gibeonite</hi> muſt be of the Communion of Saints. What Fellowſhip hath a Member of Chriſt with the Children of Belial? Yet I ſhall ſhew you how we are to love the wicked, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

            <div n="10" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>NOw I come to give you the Proofs and Reaſons, why we are to love all. For Proofs, take theſe places of Scripture. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, but eſpecially to them that are of the houſhold of faith. [While we have time]</hi> ſo ſome read; that is, While we live, let us do good to all men; as opportunity ſerveth, <hi>let us do good to every man,</hi> but eſpecially to the Saints. Our Saviour bids us, <hi>to love our enemies, Mat.</hi> 5.44. and there ſpeaks in oppoſition to that Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Tradition, That a man was bound only to love his Friends: He therefore requireth our Love to be extended to enemies, even to ſuch as curſe and hate us.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons hereof are</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe where ever we ſee any part of Gods goodneſs, we are to love it. It is ſaid
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38435:31"/> that our Saviour beholding the rich young man that came unto him, <hi>loved him, Mar.</hi> 10.21. There is ſome Print of Gods goodneſs in many that are not Godly, which ought to draw our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it; Goodneſs being the Object of Love. This is the reaſon why God himſelf lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all his Creatures, becauſe there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his Goodneſs in them. There are ſome Reliques of Gods Image in prophane men, that God beareth a general Love unto, that we alſo may do the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Love is a due debt to every man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Owe nothing to any man but to love one another;</hi> this debt is owing from every man, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually paying, and yet ever owing. The Book of Love muſt never be croſſed; although ye do never ſo many kindneſſes one to another; yet ſtill you owe mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. He payeth not his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bts, that rendereth not Love. This is a debt that grows due faſter than it can be can be paid, and muſt be always paying.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe all are partakers of the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature: That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y are men, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atures, and made as thou waſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of God; <hi>natura communis &amp; ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas rationis,</hi> the common nature and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reaſon with us ſhould draw our Love to them. The moſt brutiſh Creatures that are, and the moſt cruel, yet are loving to one another of the ſame kind; though one beaſt of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38435:31"/> another kind hath Antipathy againſt another. Shall man be more brutiſh and ſavage than Bears, Lions, and Tygers? As <hi>Solomon</hi> bids the the Sluggard to go learn of the Piſmire, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; ſo we may bid the hard-hearted man, to learn of Wolves and Tygers, to be loving one to another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe we know not who among men belong not to Gods Election of Grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to love them, and to wiſh them all Grace and Glory. And the reaſon of the School-men is, becauſe every man being a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature, is capable of Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The prophaneſt man in the world, is not altogether an hopeleſs man, unleſs it be ſuch a one as hath ſinned the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe a good man muſt be perfect in his Love, even as God is perfect: He loveth the good and the bad; he cauſeth his Sun to ſhine upon the juſt and the unjuſt. <hi>Be ye perfect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>as our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is perfect. To love them that love you, what reward have you? Do not even the Publicans the ſame? If you ſalute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Publicans the ſame?</hi> The firſt Argument is <hi>ab utili &amp; inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tili. If ye love them which love you only, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward have you?</hi> That is, ye loſe your reward, ye ſhall have no reward from God, who doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38435:32"/> for the preſent, nor for the future, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuch. Now becauſe our Saviour men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth <hi>reward,</hi> we muſt not therefore think any merit in our Love. The Reward which God giveth, is of Grace, not of Debt. Good works are rewarded, becauſe God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Reward: They are not meritorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no proportion to the Reward. The ſecond Argument is drawn <hi>à comparatis.</hi> Do not even the <hi>Publicans</hi> the ſame? but yet there is a vaſt difference implied, <hi>If you love them only that love you,</hi> then there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Diſciples and Publicans; my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do no more than they do: but your Love muſt be far more extenſive than their Love; ye muſt love ſuch whom they do not Love; ye muſt do more good than they can or will do: ye muſt exceed Publicans, Sinners, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Phariſees, in Love and the Offices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The Publicans among the Jews, were ſuch as received and gathered up the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Cuſtomes, Taxes, and Tribute, who were a very abomination to the Jews, they were a people generally hated: they were an unjuſt, defrauding oppreſſing ſort of men. No Jew would be a Publican, but abhorred the Office; becauſe they diſdained to oppreſs their own Nation, therefore they were (for the moſt part) Heathens; and to ſhew what vile peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38435:32"/> they were, they are uſually joyned with Harlots, Sinners, Heathens, yea the worſt of men. Now ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Theſe wicked Publicans do love thoſe who love them;</hi> even Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans will return kindneſs for kindneſs. The vileſt of men do love, and becauſe they love, do much good to them they love. There is a mutual exchange of kindneſſes, of beneficen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between wicked men. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.32. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>what thank have ye, if ye love them who love you? for ſinners alſo love, thoſe who love them:</hi> It is no great matter, for a man to love thoſe who love him. The Greek word there for <hi>Sinners,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth notorious, vile, abominable ſinners, ſuch as ſell themſelves to Sin and Satan to work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, even ſuch as theſe will do good to thoſe who do good to them. How doth this appear? read <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>If ye do good to them who do good to you, what thank have you? for ſinners alſo do even the ſame.</hi> Look what external Office of Love any do to Sinners, they will return all Offices of Love which lye in their power back upon them. If you viſit them, Sinners will viſit you: If you feed and cloath them in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, they will feed and cloath you in your neceſſities. This appeareth, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. where our Saviour mentioneth a particular act of Love. <hi>If ye lend to them, of whom you hope to receive, what thank have you, for ſinners alſo lend to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:38435:33"/> Now whence is it that ſuch good Offices come out of <hi>Nazareth?</hi> I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is the nature of Love, not only of the Grace of Love, planted by the Spirit of Grace; but alſo natural Love, planted by God in the Souls of all men, to return Love for love, kindneſs for kindneſs, good for good. <hi>Magnes amoris amor;</hi> Love is the Loadſtone of Love. As the Loadſtone by his vertue draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Iron to it; ſo Love ſhewn and manifeſted, draweth the Heart and Affections of others to it. Natural Love is not ſordid and ignoble, but is free and ingenuous, and is ambitious to requite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the worſt of men think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to love thoſe who love them. They know they cannot ſatisfie their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, but by a proportionable return of Love to thoſe who love them. Wicked men who make no Conſcience of loving of God, though they are under the ſtricteſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obligations that can be to love him, yet they make ſome Conſcience of loving ſuch as love them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe of the benefit and profit accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wicked men by reciprocal returns of mutual-love; there is a mutual giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving benefits: They love for civil and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable reſpects, though it be not laſting; and when the fuel ceaſeth, the flame goeth out.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:38435:33"/>4. There is pride in the heart of wicked men, which makes them diſdain to be beholden to others for their kindneſſes: Therefore they do return Love for Love, kindneſs for kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Here then ye may ſee, that there is a Love in men which is not Charity: Natural Love and Charity differ as much as Gold from Droſs and Dung. Publicans, though emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently loving, yet were very wicked. Sin and Natural Love can agree, but not Sin and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This Love and Hatred of Godlineſs can dwell together in one Soul; but Hatred and Charity cannot lie together in one heart. It is then but a ſandy foundation for any man to build his hopes of Salvation, upon his living lovingly among his loving Neighbours, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to ſuch; even ſuch hopes Publicans and Sinners may have. Therefore he that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth Heaven for his reward, muſt do more than others. <hi>What do you more than others,</hi> ſaith our Saviour? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47. The Argument runs thus. If your Love do no more than the Love of others, than your Love is no better than the Love of others. But the Love of Saints muſt do more than the Love of Sinners: My Diſciples muſt love more than Publicans; ſo that the Queſtion is preceptive, commanding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, who claimeth propriety and Intereſt in Chriſt to out-do others in offices of Love and Charity.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> I come in the ſecond place, to ſhew, How we muſt manifeſt our Love in general to the wicked. Here conſider, of what we muſt beware, and what we muſt do.</head>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Of what we muſt beware.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WE muſt not approve of, or delight in their Sins. God loveth the wicked, but in no wiſe approveth of them in their ſins: We muſt hate the Vice, but not the Perſon: God hates not the Perſons of Devils, but their Sins: We muſt follow God in this: hence are thoſe Phraſes in Scripture of God's loathing, hating, abhorring the Sins of the wicked, they are an abomination to him; and we muſt by no means approve of their Sins, and delight in them. Their Sin muſt not be our joy: that which is God's diſhonour, muſt be our grief, yea it muſt be our hatred, as it is Gods. Can a Child ſee his Father diſgraced by men, and his Bowels not yearn? If God be as dear unto us as a Father, we cannot but riſe againſt them that diſhonour him. Gods Glory muſt be dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to us than all things.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:38435:34"/>2. We muſt not any way encourage them walking in their Sins. God loveth the unjuſt, yet he threatens them with all woes and curſes, and with damnation. He tells the unclean perſon, that he will judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him: He tells the drunkard, that there is a wo unto him: He tells the proud, that they are an abomination to him: He tells all the wicked, that he will not hold them guiltleſs, that he will turn them all into Hell. The Lord gives them not the leaſt hint of mercy, to cauſe them to walk preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly in their ſins. We muſt ſay to our Friends and Neighbours that walk in ſinful ways, how do ye hope to be ſaved? what grounds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence have ye, while ye live in ſuch ſins? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ye will undo your Souls for ever, if you go on in ſuch and ſuch ſins.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>2.</hi> What we muſt do.</head>
                  <p>We muſt admoniſh and reprove them; in which duty we are too faulty. Chriſt did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove wicked men to their faces. How tartly did he deal with the Scribes and Phariſees for their Hypocriſie, and with the Jews alſo? How boldly did the Prophets reprove the great Ones; they would ſpare none, if they were wicked. But ye will ſay, that Chriſt and the Prophets did reprove them as Miniſters; and they were immediately ſent from God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38435:35"/> thoſe particular perſons. It is true; yet Miniſters in publick may reprove the ſame ſins in other perſons as ever the Prophets did. But we rather ſpeak of private reproof and admonition, which duty concerneth every man.</p>
                  <p>Therefore obſerve theſe things. Art thou a member of a Family and ſeeſt thou ſin to grow there in any Perſon? thou art faithfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and admoniſh. Haſt thou kinred or friends whom thou dearly loveſt walking in evil ways? then reprove and admoniſh. Do any of thy Familiars ſin in thy company, then reprove and admoniſh them. Art thou in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Strangers, that ſwear and curſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the holy Name of God, give a loving check to them, Why do ye curſe and ſwear?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ye will ſay, they regard it not. It is no matter, Thou doſt thy duty. Ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; We have done ſo and they do not reform. Yet ſtill reprove them; God may make thy reproofs effectual one time or other: God is patient and long-ſuffering; ſo muſt we be alſo. — You will ſay, they ſcoff and ſcorn at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. — I anſwer, Then avoid their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip as much as thou canſt. We do expreſs more Love to one another, by reproving one another, than by any thing; it is a ſign we deſire the good of one anothers Souls. True Love is mixed of ſweetneſs and ſharpneſs: It
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38435:35"/> is a kind of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a bitter-ſweet: it hath not only ſweet meats, but pills, corroſives, as well as healing plaiſters: it can wound as well as heal; yea it muſt wound that it may heal. If a Chriſtian ſee ſeculent matter that nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth vice, cleave to any one, true love will cauſe him to ſtrain a point of kindneſs to purge it out, albeit with more rough than pleaſing Phyſick; faithful are the wounds of ſuch a friend. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Melius eſt cum ſeveritate dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, quàm cum lenitate decipere.</hi> Better is a ſevere kind of Love, than a deceitful Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>There are two reaſons, why we muſt in Love to the wicked, thus behave our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe our Love to them muſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally aim at their converſion, reformation and ſalvation. As God laboureth by his goodneſs to draw men to repentance, ſo muſt we by our Love; and what better courſe can we take than by reproving them, by telling them of the fearful danger they are in, and that ſuch courſes will undoubtedly bring them to Hell. When wicked men ſhall ſee we diſlike their courſes, and grieve at them, God may ſet it home upon them, to make them the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their own ſins. Should we not ſhew our diſlike of ſuch courſes, we ſhould harden and confirm them in their ſins, and ſo to be an occaſion of their deſperate impenitency.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:38435:36"/>2. Becauſe otherwiſe we ſhew neither Love to them, nor to our ſelves: we make our ſelves partakers of their ſins: neglect of reproof is a tacit conſent to them in their ſins: ſhould we any way encourage them, we ſhould be abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of them: Should we any way delight in their ſins, God would lay them to our ſcore.</p>

                  <p>THE third thing I am to treat of, is, Love to our Enemies. Here in the firſt place, Let us conſider, what this Love is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſteth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not a Love in word and in tongue, but an affectionate Love, a Loving in heart and in deed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. <hi>be kindly affectioned one to another:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, be naturally affectionate, as the Dams among Creatures, are naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to their young ones. Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>[Love thine enemies]</hi> reacheth the heart, and enjoyns thee to affect them, as well as the tongue, to ſpeak loving words unto them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:38435:36"/>2 It is a Love, that ſets us upon the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all duties of Love toward them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To love them with a Love of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>to bleſs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m that curſe you,</hi> to wiſh them good when they wiſh you evil, to ſpeak well of them, when they ſpeak all manner of evil of you, <hi>this is to love our enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be willing to pardon their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done unto us.</p>
                  <p>So the Parable of the two debtors teacheth us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.25. The King pardoned one which owed him ten thouſand talents: and he was to pardon his fellow that owed him an hundred pence; which thing becauſe he would not do, his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. <hi>The diſcretion of a man defers his anger, and it is his glory to paſs over a tranſgreſſion.</hi> Men think it but baſeneſs and cowardlineſs to put up wrongs; but God ſaith, it is his wiſdom, his glory, his diſcretion. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thine enemies have done thee great wrongs, and many injuries; the more is thy love manifeſted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Heartily to rejoyce in the gifts and parts of our enemies, and in whatſoever is is excellent in them, and to be glad of their proſperity, and to lament when it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with them. Thus <hi>David</hi> made La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation for <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>The beauty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38435:37"/> of Iſrael is ſlain upon thy high places. v.</hi> 24 25. <hi>Ye daughters of Iſrael weep over Saul, who clothed you in ſcarlet with other delights, who put on orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midſt of the battel!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To love them with a Love of beneficence: To do them all the good we can; to do all the good we can to their bodies, to do them good ſpeedily and without delay, and conſtantly without any willing neglect, when it lieth in our power. <hi>Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you.</hi> Mat. 5.44. <hi>If thine enemy hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, feed him; if he thirſt give him drink; for in ſo doing, thou ſhalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</hi> Rom. 12.20. either coals of <hi>converſion,</hi> or co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls of <hi>confuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 To love them with a religious Love, Love your enemies, <hi>pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, Luk.</hi> 6.28. Pray for their health when they are ſick; pray for their lives when they are in the gates of death; pray for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, when they are compaſſed about with dangers, or oppreſſed with troubles: pray for their Converſion, Pardon and Salvation. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe wicked men vex thy Soul as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> did <hi>Lot</hi> for righteouſneſs ſake, and hate thee for thy Love, yet pray for them. So <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l</hi> 109.4.5. <hi>For my Love they are my adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but I give my ſelf unto prayer.</hi> Suppoſe they perſecute thee even to the death, yet thou art
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38435:37"/> to pity them, and pray for them. Thus our Saviour prayed for his enemies, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prayed heartily for all his Perſecutors. <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their charge.</hi> He prayed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for them, when they were ſtoning him to death. When <hi>Davids</hi> enemies were plotting his death, he prayed for their good, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Soul with faſting, and cloathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Sackcloth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13. So St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Being reviled, we bleſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed we entreat.</hi> The helliſh rage of enemies muſt move you to ſhew your heavenly love to them. This is the Love we muſt ſhew to our enemies, and this Love exceeds that of <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe their Love is extended no farther than to their brethren their benefactors; where they find Love, there they return Love; they return good to none but to ſuch from whom they receive good; where no Love is ſhewn, there they will ſhew no Love; they will return evil for evil; What others meaſure to them, they will meaſure the ſame to them again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe their Love at beſt, is but verbal and complemental, conſiſting rather in wiſhing than in ſupplying. They have words at will, Oyl and Butter enough in their mouth to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all, but they keep all to themſelves, they have little to ſpare to their Neighbour, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38435:38"/> his need be. They give as good words as need to be, <hi>Depart in peace, be warmed, and filled.</hi> but give him not thoſe things that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Love of <hi>Publicans</hi> laſteth no longer than their friends Love laſteth; they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten change in their affections. How often is the Love of carnal men turned into Hatred, and their friend-ſhip into enmity? the Love of <hi>Publicans</hi> is but Love of retaliation; but this Love is a conſtant Love. Let their enemies ſmile or frown, they love them. Let their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies do good to them or do evil, ſtill they love them, and do good unto them; let their enemies bleſs or curſe them, yet they love them; yea when their enemies are in their height of malice, they love them and pray for them. Many waters of their enemies unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the raging floods of their enemies malice, ſhall neither quench it nor drown it. They may cool it, but cannot quench it: they may for a while keep down the Flames, but cannot put out the coal of Love within them.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Now I will ſhew, bow no Publicans or wicked men can love their enemies.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THey may ſpeak fair to their enemies, but this is not Love: <hi>their words are ſmoother than oyl, yet</hi> then <hi>their hearts are full of gall and bitterneſs,</hi> and of miſchievous devices. <hi>Joab</hi> ſpake friendly to <hi>Abner,</hi> while his heart was full of murderous intents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They may ſalute their enemies, yet then, as <hi>Judas,</hi> they may ſeek an occaſion to betray them, as he did, by a kiſs and an embrace: and while they flatter them, they ſpread a net for their feet, making them a ſure prey: and if their feet be entangled, they are faſt enough for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away.</p>
                  <p>Yet no wicked man can, or doth Love his enemies, ſo as to wiſh well to them as often as they have opportunity: they cannot, they will not pray for them, but when occaſion is given, they will curſe ſuch as bleſs them, and will deal deſpitefully with them. The reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this Love is a fruit of the Spirit, and proceedeth from grace. And it is as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38435:39"/> for Thorns to bring forth grapes, as for a wicked man to bring forth ſuch fruits of the Spirit. This Love that I ſpeak of, groweth no where out of Paradiſe, but in a gracious heart: there is no ſuch flower to be found in Natures Garden. Though men naturally love their kinred, and their friends, yet they cannot love their enemies. Naturally men hate their enemies; Nature judgeth it ſeemly and ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to to be revenged on enemies; to give the ſame meaſure that their enimies meaſure to them. Every natural man is of the <hi>Phariſee</hi>'s judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That we are bound to love them that love us, and hate our enemies. Hence it is, that men bring Arguments to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their malitious actings againſt their enemies, and ſatiſfie themſelves with their own fallacious argumentations.</p>
                  <p>That wicked men cannot love their enemies, will appear, if we conſider what their hearts are filled with. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. The Apoſtle ſaith, they are <hi>filled with all unrighteouſneſs, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, malitiouſneſs, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity.</hi> Did not God ſet a dam, and keep within the banks, thoſe ſeas of malice in mens hearts, the whole world would ſoon be drowned in the flood of maliciouſneſs. Now before it is poſſible for a wicked man to love his enemies, his heart muſt be emptied of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, hatred and malice: the Spirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38435:39"/> muſt in a wonderful manner dry up this Sea of wickedneſs, and they muſt be brought to caſt out Envy, Hatred and Malice out of their Hearts, as they would Toads out of their Boſoms.</p>

Pſal.</hi> 139 27.22. I hate none but Gods enemies, thoſe I count mine enemies. I am not troubled at him that wrongeth my perſon or good name, but at him that blaſphemeth my God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth his Truth, and his Saints for the name of Chriſt; theſe do I count my enemies. <hi>I have have hated the congregation of evil doers, and will not ſit with wicked, Pſal.</hi> 26.5. He would not ſo much as ſit with them, becauſe he hated them. As friendſhip with the world is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38435:40"/> with God, ſo to contract friendſhip with the wicked, is to joyn with Gods enemies, and to cauſe him to turn enemy to him that ſo doth. See what a ſharp check was given to <hi>Jehoſhaphar</hi> for joyning in friendſhip with two wicked Kings, as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Shouldſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from the Lord.</hi> David did ſet light by the hatred of the world, but yet ſtrived ſtoutly for the maintenance of Gods Glory, inſomuch that he would undertake open war againſt all the Enemies of God. Hence ſprang all thoſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curſes and imprecations that <hi>David</hi> in many <hi>Pſalms</hi> doth wiſh againſt the wicked for their enmity againſt God, and hatred of him. Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. and ſee how <hi>David</hi> there doth curſe <hi>Judas,</hi> and all the enemies of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Theſe imprecations againſt Gods enemies are uttered ſometimes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Per modum pronuntiationis, non per modum optionis,</hi> by way of prediction, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them.

                  <p>Sometimes when the deſtruction of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God is wiſhed or deſired, <hi>deſiderium optantis ad juſtitiam punientis, non ad poenam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur:</hi>

So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.10.11. <hi>The Righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance, be ſhall waſh his feet in the blood of the wicked; ſo that a man ſhall ſay, Verily there is a reward for the Righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.</hi> Gods Glory manifeſted in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the wicked, is matter of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Saints, not ſimply their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is <hi>ad remotionem culpae, non ad deſtructio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem peccantis,</hi> that Sin might be removed, not that the Sinner ſhould be deſtroyed.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how are godly men ſaid to hate, and how may they hate wicked men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. We muſt hate their ſins, not their perſons, all their ſins as well as one ſin, and in all wicked men as well as in one wicked man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt hate them as they are Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; not as they are our own particular ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>David</hi> did humble himſelf for his own enemies; but as for the enemies of God and his Church, them he hated with a perfect hatred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our hatred muſt be with hope and deſire of their converſion, and not with deſpair. And in this there is more Love ſhewn than hatred; we muſt hate them as Gods enemies, yet not plot their evil in any thing, but pray for their good,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38435:41"/> and do them all the good we can, as occaſion ſerveth; Grace only can do this. Here ſee the excellency of Grace, it makes a man truly to hate ſin in all, and yet to love all likewiſe.</p>

               <p>IN the fourth place I am to ſhew, That God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men muſt eſpecially love one another. True Love, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is, <hi>motus animi ad fruendum Deo propter ipſum; ſe, &amp; proximum, propter Deum;</hi> A motion of the Soul to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of God for himſelf, and himſelf and his Neighbour for Gods ſake: Wherefore as God is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that beleeve; So a Chriſtian is to be a lover of all men, but eſpecially thoſe of the houſhold of Faith. <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him,</hi> 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.1. And this he doth, as being a better argument of true goodneſs, than his beleeving. For if the Queſtion be, whether a man be good, <hi>it is not demanded</hi> (ſaith the ſame Father) <hi>what he beleeveth, but what he loveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This love is ſtrictly required of all Chriſtians. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>See that ye love one another with a pure heart, fervently;</hi> our Love to the Saints muſt be fervent Love, &amp; then pure and unfeigned Love.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:38435:42"/>
               <p>As the Angels are called <hi>Seraphims</hi> from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as ſome think) becauſe they burn in Love to God and to his Saints, ſo there muſt be this Seraphical burning Love in the Godly, to the Godly. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>All my delight is in the Saints.</hi> In the foregoing verſe, he acknowledgeth he can beſtow nothing upon God: <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not to thee;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he manifeſteth his Love to God in loving his Saints that are in the earth; them he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>the excellent of the earth:</hi> Godly men are the truly excellent; Grace is the trueſt dignity of a man. <hi>[In whom is all my delight]</hi> I take no delight in any Company, more than in the ſweet and Godly fellowſhip and communion of Saints. Therefore <hi>Philemon</hi> is commended by St. <hi>Paul</hi> for his Love to all the Saints. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Above all things put on Charity.</hi> The Apoſtle verſe 12, preſſeth them to get and exerciſe ſundry Graces: <hi>put on bowels of mercy, kindneſs, and humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing and forgiving one another; and above all things put on charity.</hi> The Apoſtle alludeth to Garments; the other Graces are the inward Graces of a Chriſtian; Love is the glorious Raiment of Needle-work. Charity muſt be the <hi>veſtis exterior,</hi> the outward Garment, the cloathing of Gold. But <hi>Calvin</hi> expoundeth the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by <hi>propter,</hi> and not by <hi>ſuper;</hi> for all theſe things put on Charity. This is the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38435:42"/> Queen commandeth all other Graces. Love produceth the actions of all other Graces, <hi>non elicitivè ſed imperativè,</hi> it is Love that makes men merciful, and full of pity and compaſſion to their diſtreſſed Brethren: Where no Love is, there is nothing but Fury, Wrath and Madneſs, Envy and Contentions. It is Love that makes men humble, preferring one anothers Gifts and Graces, rejoycing in one anothers Proſperity. Where this Godly Love is not, there is nothing but repining at one anothers Proſperity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the Evils of each other.</p>
               <p>It is Charity that makes men meek and long-ſuffering, it will make a man put up many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, wrongs and injuries.</p>
               <p>It is the want of this Love, that makes men account it cowardice to put up wrongs; Oh ſay they, it is not the true mark of a Gentleman to put up wrongs; but ſure I am, it is the true mark of a Godly Chriſtian. Will men prefer Gentility before Chriſtianity; and carnal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is Deviliſh, and cometh from Hell, above that wiſdom which cometh down from Heaven, and is Gentle and Peaceable?</p>
               <p>Love will make us to forgive one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake forgiveth us, as heartily, as freely, as fully as Chriſt doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſins. It is the want of this Love that makes men ſo revengful; Hence Love is ſaid to be the bond of perfectneſs, (in regard of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38435:43"/> the Church) Love uniteth all the Members of Chriſt together; and makes them to perform their ſeveral duties to each other. 2. In regard of all the Graces of Gods Spirit; Love ſtirreth them up, and ſets every Grace to do their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral offices. Hence Love is ſtiled, <hi>the fulfilling of the Law:</hi> it keeps men from doing evil, it ſets men upon doing all good.</p>

               <p>THe Reaſons why Chriſtians muſt ſhew ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Love one to another, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God himſelf beſtoweth his moſt ſpecial Love, the riches of his Love, upon the Godly; his everlaſting Love is towards <hi>Jacob.</hi> As a man loveth his whole Family, but his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Love is to his Wife and Children. So God, although he loveth all the world, all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet his ſpecial Love is to his Saints. God's common and ordinary Love to all mankind, to the wicked, is but like the crums that fall from the rich mans Table; but his ſpecial Love and Favour are the Dainties upon that Table, which none but his Church doth feed upon. God cauſeth the Sun in the Firmament to ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the juſt and the unjuſt. The light of the Sun is a great, yet common mercy; but God hath promiſed, that he will be a Sun and Shield to his Saints, and give both Grace and Glory. God will give the Light of the Sun to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but the Godly only ſhall enjoy the Light of his Countenance. He will give to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rain, the Dew of the Clouds; but the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only ſhall have the Dew of Heaven poured on them. If the Lord doth beſtow the chief of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38435:44"/> his Love upon his people, then muſt we Love them as God doth, and beſtow the chief of our Love upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt himſelf loveth the Godly above all; he thinketh nothing too dear, too good for his Saints, his Blood, his Life, his Righteouſneſs, his Spirit, his Grace, his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his Kingdom. He thought no evil too great to ſuffer for his Saints, What Reproaches, what Blaſphemies, what contradictions of Sinners? What Pangs, what Sorrows, what Tortures, what Agonies did his ſpotleſs Soul endure? if here be no Love to the Saints, where is it? Ye then that profeſs your ſelves to be Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, imitate your Maſter in this, in beſtowing your beſt Love upon thoſe that are truly Godly. <hi>By this ſhall all men know, that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another, Joh.</hi> 13.35. In this ſence to be a Diſciple of Chriſt, is to be a Child of God; for it is meant of a practical Diſciple, one that learneth of Chriſt not only by his Word to know his Will, but alſo by his Word and Spirit to follow him. It is as if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had ſaid, your gifts of working Miracles, and caſting out Devils in my Name, your prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my Word, your Praying, are not ſuch ſigns that ye are my Diſciples, as your Mutual-Love. I your Maſter do love you, and what is your Love one to another, but a reflected beam of my Love?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:38435:44"/>3. The Holy Ghoſt loveth the Saints chiefly; he is pleaſed to make their Hearts his Temple to live and dwell in. The Spirit hath his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them, he hath deſired them for his Habitation; he ever keeps home in a Godly mans heart; he dwelleth in him, and ſhall be in him. And as himſelf, ſo his Graces ſhall ſtill abide in him. <hi>The anointing which ye have received from him, abideth in you.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27. <hi>The comforter ſhall abide with you for ever, Joh.</hi> 14.16. So ſhall his Comforts too, though not always alike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The Spirit dwelling in a Chriſtian, ſtoreth him plentifully. His Divine Power gives him all things pertaining to Life and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. This unfeigned Love to the Children of God, is a ſpecial and principal fruit of the Spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith.</hi> Love is in the forefront. Now it is by this Spirit of God, that Men and Women are regenerate and born of God. By this Spirit they are born again, and made the Children of God, and the ſame Spirit which giveth them this new birth, doth bring forth in them this fruit of Love. Now ſeeing the All-glorious Trinity love the Saints ſo dearly; ſo peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is there not reaſon we ſhould do ſo? If we love not as God loveth, in ſetting our ſpecial Love, where he ſets his ſpecial Love, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be followers of God as dear Children.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:38435:45"/>4. The Holy Angels are ready to do Godly men all the offices of Love, and take ſpecial care of them: now the Saints ſhall be in Heaven as the Angels of God are; let us then be like them here upon Earth. The Angels of God are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do any office of Love for the meaneſt Saints: they are their miniſtring Spirits for their good. Shall not we then love thoſe whom the glorified Angels do ſo dearly and tenderly Love?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe of that near union which the Saints have with God and Chriſt, therefore we muſt beſtow our ſpecial Love upon them. Chriſt and his Saints are ſo neerly united to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they are ſaid <hi>to be one:</hi> they are one in Spirit. So that if God and Chriſt have our ſpecial Love, the Saints that are one with God and Chriſt muſt have our ſpecial Love alſo. And he that doth not love a Saint, doth not love God with ſpecial Love; he that doth not love the Saints above others, doth not love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things. God, Chriſt, and all the Saints are but one entire object of our Charity: only here is the difference; God and Chriſt is to be loved for himſelf, and the Saints are to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for God, and in God: <hi>In God,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; <hi>for God,</hi> by vertue of his Command. So that our Love to the Saints is <hi>per redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> it doth redound from God to the Saints. Chriſt and the Saints are as a Man and Wife; he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38435:45"/> that doth not heartily love the Wife, doth not truly love the Husband, becauſe they are but one Fleſh: So it is in our Love to Chriſt and his Saints, who make but one myſtical Body. He that loveth not the Members of the Body, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the Head.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe the glorified Body of Chriſt in the Heavens were upon the Earth with us, no doubt but we would be very officious and reſpective of it, and in an holy Emulation we would ſtrive who could manifeſt greateſt Love to his glorified Body. How would ye cry out Oh yonder is the Body that was whipt and ſcourged, buffeted, peirced, nailed, and broken for us; that glorified Body, was the Body that was crucified for me: Let me be <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> if I ſhould not love him that loved me in ſo wonderful a manner. But as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid to <hi>Judas</hi> repining at the coſt beſtowed upon him, <hi>Me you ſhall not have always, but the poor ye ſhall have always among you;</hi> ſo may he ſay to us, Me you have not among you; but I leave among you a moſt fit Object for your Love. I leave my poor Saints to be with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, which I do as much reſpect, as I do this glorified <hi>Maſſe</hi> united to my Godhead. What Love ye beſtow on my Saints, I will ſet it on my ſcore, as if ye had done it to my glorified Body. Therefore ſuch do but prate of Love to Chriſt, as do not love his Members. And were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38435:46"/> the Lord Jeſus upon Earth, converſant among men; they that grieve, mock, and hate the Saints, and ſhun their company, would do the ſame to Chriſt himſelf. Tell me, can that ſore eye that cannot endure to look upon a Candle, but it ſmarteth and aketh, can it endure to look upon the Sun? He that can not endure to ſee a ſpark of Grace &amp; Holineſs ſhining in a Saint, but he hates and ſcoffs at it, would that man endure to ſee the Sun of righteouſneſs himſelf? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſuch men would hate Chriſt, if he were living among them, as they do the Saints.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe where the ſpecial Good is, upon that muſt our ſpecial Love be beſtowed. It is the rule of the School-men, <hi>ut ſimpliciter ad ſimpliciter, ſic magis ad magis, et maximè ad maximeè;</hi> that is, If that which is ſimply good be to be loved, then that which is better is to have more Love; and that which is the beſt good is to have the beſt Love. What is the beſt thing in man, if Grace be not? will ye ſay Riches is better than Grace? then a rich Man (becauſe rich) is to be preferred and loved above a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man Will ye ſay Beauty is better than Grace? then a fair Face is to be eſteemed above the Beauty of Holineſs. Will ye ſay the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Natural Parts is better than Grace? then an Heathen Philoſopher may be loved bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Child of God. Is moral Honeſty better than Grace? then a dunghil covered
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38435:46"/> with Snow, is better than an Houſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble full of Gold. What are the things men love moſt? take a ſurvey of them all; and ye ſhall find Gods Image in the Saints is beſt. What doth God regard in men? do you think he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth a rich <hi>Nabal</hi> for his Riches, an exalted <hi>Haman</hi> for his Honours; a voluptuous <hi>Eſau</hi> for his Pleaſures; or an indiſcreet Woman for her Beauty? Do ye think he looketh upon Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any reſpect? Theſe things are not the good he loveth, but Grace only. Grace is Gods own Nature, and ſhall he turn his eyes from himſelf? Grace is Spiritual Riches, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Beauty, Spiritual Honour; it is all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in a Spiritual way, therefore chiefly to be beloved. Did ye ſee an Angel in his Glory, you would ſay, indeed he is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lovely Creature; it is Gods Image that makes him ſo, and it is the ſame for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a Saint on Earth: Want of Love to the Saints, is our own blindneſs, becauſe we do not conceive the worth and excellency of Grace in the Saints. Swine trample upon Pearl, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not the worth of it: So wicked men ſlight the Godly, not perceiving the worth of Grace in them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe our Love to the Saints manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we are of the Communion of Saints. Love is the Soul and Life of the Communion of Saints; it is the bond of perfection; it bindeth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38435:47"/> the Saints up in one Body; it is the Corner-Stone which holdeth the ſides of the Wall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; it is that which makes Chriſts Church like his Coat without Rent. It was the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Philoſophers, That the whole world was but one Body, and that there is one Soul of the World, that holdeth the parts of the World: ſo much more, there is a Spirit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which uniteth the Members of it with the Spirit of Love. And, as the members of a Mans Body will fall aſunder, were there not uniting parts in them, as Sinews and Muſcles joyning them together; ſo the Communion of Saints, is held and maintained by the bond of Love.</p>
               <p>See how diverſly the Scripture ſets forth the Communion of Saints by ſuch tearms, as do call for ſpecial Love. They are ſaid to be <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> muſt not one Brother love another above a ſtranger? they are ſaid to be Members of one Body; muſt not one Member help another Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame Body, before others of another Body? They are all ſaid to be one Spouſe of Chriſt; all the Saints together make up the Church, which is the Wife of Chriſt: So the Saints ſhould love one another, as if there were no Saints but themſelves. They are all ſaid to be made partakers of one Divine Nature. Who will not love his own, Fleſh, his own Nature better than anothers? In loving the Saints thou
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38435:47"/> doſt but love thy ſelf. They are ſaid to be one Houſhold; the Church is called, The Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of the Faithful. As in a Family, there is one Boord, one Bread, one Cup among neer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives: So Chriſtians ſhould have one Heart, one Mind, one Affection, and ſhould hold and cleave together. Such Love there was among Chriſtians in the Primitive times, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens obſerving it, ſaid, Oh how do the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians love one another!</p>
               <p n="8">8. Becauſe we are to live with them to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, therefore Saints ſhould have our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Love. When all the wicked of the world ſhall be turned into Hell, be they never ſo great, or never ſo dear unto us; ye that are Saints, ye ſhall lye together in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, dwell together in thoſe Manſions, which Chriſt your Head and your Saviour hath prepared for you in the higheſt Heavens, enjoying God together, following Jeſus Chriſt the Lamb, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom together, praiſing God together; ye ſhall reign with Chriſt together, be glorified together. Are your Friends rich and mighty on Earth; and are the Saints poor, deſpicable, and miſerable in the World? yet theſe poor Saints ſhall live in Heaven with you, when the cruel <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Earth, ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Hell.</p>
               <p>Is there not Reaſon that we ſhould love them moſt, that are Fellow-Heirs of one and the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38435:48"/> ſame Kingdom, our Eternal Neighbours in Heaven, fellow-Citizens of the Heavenly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem? It is a true <hi>Axiom</hi> of the Schools; <hi>Societas fruitionis divinae eſt fundamentum charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis; ergo inter proximorum praecipua charitatis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecta, ſunt ſancti homines,</hi> (i. e.) The common participation of one and the ſame eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Happineſs, is the main Foundation of Charity. Therefore they infer truly, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our Neighbours, the Saints are the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Objects of our Love.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

                  <p>I Come now to ſhew, How we are to love one another. The manner of our mutual-Love, the Scripture ſets down by two expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>As thy ſelf.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>As Chriſt loved us.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, Thou muſt love thy Neighbour, <hi>as thy ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who is there, that wiſheth not all the good that may be to himſelf? Doth any ſober man wiſh any harm to himſelf? So muſt thou heartily deſire the good of others. Thus <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> wiſhed, <hi>That all the Lords people were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> he wiſhed every man like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſireth from his heart, <hi>That all Iſrael might be ſaved.</hi> Rom. 10.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who is not affected with his own Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Afflictions? So muſt thou; when thou ſeeſt others in Miſery, Thou muſt weep with them that weep, and make their Loſſes and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries to become thine own.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Who doth not pray heartily for himſelf,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38435:49"/> for Gods Bleſſing on all things he ſets his hand unto? So muſt thou pray for others, with the ſame fervency which thou uſeſt in praying for thy ſelf; pray for that which will do them moſt good, that they may every way be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee; that thou maiſt find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as <hi>Laban</hi> did, That the Lord hath bleſt them for thy ſake.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Who doth not endeavour his own good with all his might? The like care muſt thou have of thy Neighbours good, eſpecially of the Saints. Love is a diligent Affection, and the Fountain of Diligence. <hi>Diligentia</hi> may well be derived <hi>à diligendo,</hi> Diligence from Dilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Loving, the things (as one ſaith) are conjugate no leſs than the names. Thy Love muſt be a labouring Love; a Love, that is <hi>full of mercy and good fruits.</hi> The Apoſtle aſcribeth Work and Labour unto Love, becauſe Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth no pains, it will ſpend and be ſpent, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there, where is leaſt Love returned for moſt expended.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Who doth not rejoyce in his own good? Thou doſt never envy thy ſelf thine own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; So muſt thou rejoyce in the Gifts, Parts, Graces, and Proſperity of others. To envy at one anothers good, is ſome of the Poyſon of the old Serpent, which he ſpitteth: It is the principal quality of Devils to envy the Saints Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:38435:49"/>6. Who is there, that is weary in doing good to himſelf? When doth a man ceaſe to do good to himſelf? So muſt thou do to others. Thou muſt never be weary in well-doing to them; <hi>A Friend</hi> (a true Chriſtian Friend) <hi>loveth at all times, Prov.</hi> 17.17. Let thy Love to thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be without envy in Proſperity; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearineſs in Adverſity When the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lover is to his Friend as the Cuckoo, that affords you his company, till you be weary of him in Summer, but before Winter cometh takes his leave; Be thou to thy Brother, as the Black-bird, that keeps conſtantly with us; and is of uſe (if need be) to feed us in Winter.</p>
                  <p>Every man knoweth what is good for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; thence doth a good man conclude, if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Mercy, Knowledg, Grace, Credit be good for me, then are they good for my Brother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and he will labour to procure them, that he may ſerve his Brother <hi>through love, Gal.</hi> 5.13. intending his good more than his own, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him.</p>
                  <p>True it is, a man in loving another, may have ſome reſpect to himſelf; if he be Wiſe, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, Learned, to learn of him: If Humble, Loving, Holy, to imitate him: If any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, to be a Gainer by him, in a way of God, not of Luſt, or of the World. But this is not the firſt and principal thing for which the Chriſtian loveth another, but as the reſult;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38435:50"/> not as the moving Cauſe, but as the Reward of Love; as Man and Wife, by ſhewing more Love to each other for Love's ſake, do reap more Love from each other.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p n="2">II. WE muſt love one another <hi>as Chriſt loved us.</hi> Chriſt loved us when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him, <hi>Herein is the Love of God commended to us, that when we were enemies, Chriſt died for us, Rom.</hi> 5.8. Yea, when we were enemies to Chriſt, and he might have wrought our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, yet then he ſought to us for our Love, entreating us to be reconciled unto him; he came to ſeek the loſt Sheep of the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. What ſurpaſſing Love is this, That the great God ſhould come, and ſeek to his own Creatures for their Love; that the Cedar ſhould make ſuit to, the Thiſtle? What had Chriſt loſt by it, if every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> had been turned into Hell? Could he not have made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World of Men to have glorified him, and to reign with him in Glory? yet that he ſhould ſeek to us to be reconciled to him, here is ſurpaſſing Love. So muſt we love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Are we injurious to one another, and at variance one with another, then let us ſeek to one another for reconciliation.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:38435:50"/>
                  <p>Chriſt ſo loved us, that he was willing to lay down his Life for us. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his Life for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. Chriſts could not ſhew greater Love to us than in dying for us. Chriſts Love to us is the <hi>ultimum reſolubile,</hi> the laſt thing into which all his actions in the work of our Redemption is reſolved. Do ye ask, Why God was incarnate, why he ſuffered death, why he endured ſuch contradiction of Sinners, ſuch Mockings, ſuch a bloody Agony in the Garden, this anſwereth all, Becauſe he loved us. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf to death for me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. The Apoſtle ſpeaks here in the Perſon of all Beleevers. Theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reaſons may demonſtrate to us, that Chriſts Love was the Cauſe that made him to lay down his Life for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> 1. Becauſe there was no deſert in us. It is not our Love to him firſt, that made him to love us; no, <hi>we love him, becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> Our Love to him, is the effect and conſequent of his Love to us, not the cauſe of his Love. What is there in any man conſidered as fallen from God, that can deſerve ſuch incomprehenſible Love, as that God ſhould dye for us? Can Sin deſerve the Love of Chriſt? What is a natural Man, but a very Body of Sin? We do not, nor can we Love God, becauſe we are enmity to him. <hi>Amor deſcendit, non aſcendit.</hi> There is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38435:51"/> more Love in a Father to a Child, than in a Child to a Father: His Love did firſt deſcend to us, before our Love could aſcend to him. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſets forth the odious and moſt undeſerving condition of Man under a Parable of a polluted Infant, when we were moſt forlorn, polluted, and moſt helpleſs, then was <hi>the time of Love, Ezek.</hi> 16. When thou waſt wallowing in thine own filthineſs, then was <hi>the time of Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Chriſt reaps no good by us. What if <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity had been damned, he had loſt no whit of his Bleſſedneſs; he was infinitely happy from everlaſting, and ſo is to everlaſting, and would be; had not a man been partaker of his Glory, therefore it muſt needs be his meer Love to us; and ſuch a Love as doth earneſtly deſire and tender our everlaſting good and Salvation. It was for our Reconciliation and Juſtification that he endured Wrath, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Redemptoin; he ſhed his Blood for us miſerable Creatures, to make us eternally happy, Sons of God, and Heirs of Salvation. What Motive or Ground had Chriſt to dye and ſuffer, if it were not his meer Love to us; ſo that we may well cry out with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> O Lord, thou haſt loved me more than thy ſelf, becauſe thou wouldſt dye for me, and not for thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe Chriſt laid down his Life being
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38435:51"/> never deſired of us, therefore meer Love to us did encline him to dye for us. Had Men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Counſel together, to deviſe a means to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Gods Wrath; had men been let alone to themſelves, they would never have regarded Salvation at all. All our care would have been how to ſin, how to fulfil our Luſts; we ſhould never have prayed, Lord ſend thy Son into the world to dye for us, to ſave us, to redeem us from Sin and Damnation; therefore it was his Mercy occaſioned by our Miſery, meerly his Love that made him to dye for us. When Gods Juſtice was pleading hard for the damnation of ſinful men, What do ſuch Rebels here on earth? Why doſt thou not O Lord, make theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Sinners to ſmart for their Rebellion? as Thou haſt turned them out of Paradiſe, ſo turn them out of the World into Hell; Let them know what it is to taſte of the Forbidden Fruit; Then did Chriſt without ſuing to him, plead as hard for us, Father ſpare them, and puniſh me; bleſs them, let me be made a Curſe; be at peace with them, let me endure thy Wrath: I will go, and keep thy Law, becauſe they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it; let the Sorrows of Hell compaſs me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that they may enter into thine unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Joys; Love therefore muſt be the meer Motive. Had we deſired Chriſt to have laid down his Life for us, there were ſome extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Motive, yet Love ſtill; but in that Chriſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:38435:52"/> was found of them that ſought him not, and in that he is made known to them, and given to them, and for them that never ſought after him, it is meer and wonderful Love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe he was very willing to dye for us: Greater Love hath no man, then for a man to lay down his Life for his Friend. It is <hi>maximus fluxus, maximum opus, maximum beneficium, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum irrefragabile dilectionis;</hi> The greateſt Flux of Love, the greateſt work, the greateſt benefit, an irrefragable argument of Love, ſaith <hi>Pariſienſis.</hi> And to ſhew his willingneſs, Chriſt ſaith of his Paſſion, <hi>deſiderio deſideravi,</hi> with a deſire have I deſired it. Chriſt did earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to drink of the Cup of his Fathers Wrath, that we might not taſte it; would he have drunk of ſuch a bitter Cup, if he did not love us? His willingneſs to dye for us, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his Love. He laid down his Life for us; it was not in the power of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and all the Jews, his enemies, to take away his Life from him: Chriſt did willingly dye. Indeed <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned him; the Jews cried out, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him;</hi> they carried him to <hi>Calvary</hi> as a Malefactor with Spears, yet if he had pleaſed, they could not have put him to death. Had not his own free Love opened his heart, no Souldier could ever have opened his ſide; no though <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> ſhould have had all the Roman Legions, and the whole Power of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38435:52"/> the Empire under his charge. They might as ſoon have plucked the Sun out of his Orb, as have ſundered Chriſts Soul from his Body: As ſoon have brought a Sea of Waters out of a Rock, as have ſpilt one drop of his Blood; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had yeelded himſelf to death. <hi>Walk in love,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and given himſelf for us an offering, and a ſacrifice to God of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> Eph. 5.2.</p>
                  <p>Would ye but walk a few turns with Chriſt in the Garden, where he felt the Agony in his Soul: Would ye go up to <hi>Calvary,</hi> and ſee what our bleſſed Saviour did there endure, then would ye ſay, Herein we perceive the Love of Chriſt, in that he laid down his Life for us. When the Jews ſaw Chriſt weeping over <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> they cried out, <hi>Behold how he loved him:</hi> but go ye up to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> look through his Stripes and Wounds, into his heavy and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented heart; look upon his ſtriped back, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his buffeted Face, upon his pierced ſide, his bloody head, hands and feet, ſee what he did and ſuffered for us, then ye cannot but ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how he loved us! Oh what manner of Love is this!</p>

                  <p>NOw we muſt love one another, <hi>even as Chriſt hath loved us.</hi> Now if Chriſt of his meer Love, hath laid down his Life for us, then we ought alſo to lay down our lives for the Brethren. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. This would have ſeemed an hard ſaying to us, if it had been nakedly propoſed in ſuch terms as theſe, <hi>we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren;</hi> but the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before laid down ſuch a ſtrong Argument aforehand, doth in a moſt convincing manner infer this upon it, as an undeniable concluſion, which cannot with any ſhew of reaſon be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed, or contradicted. Chriſt the eternal Son of God, hath manifeſted his ſingular Love, in laying down his Life for us; we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow the Captain of our Salvation in this incomparable act of Love. We were dearer to him than his blood, than his Life; ſo the Saints good muſt be dearer to us than our hearts blood, than our pretious Life. Here I will lay down this Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſtians being called unto it, ought to ſhew ſo much Love to their Brethren, as to lay down their Lives for them. In this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, two things are to be conſidered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:38435:53"/>
                     <item>1. The Thing required.</item>
                     <item>2. The Condition ſuppoſed.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Thing required is this, That Chriſtians ſhould lay down their Lives for the Brethren. The Condition ſuppoſed is this, If they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto it. For the former we muſt know, that although Chriſtians muſt not think their Lives too dear for the Brethren, yet it is in this as it is in other duties of Love and Mercy towards men; the firſt and greateſt Commandment muſt give Life unto the ſecond, which is like unto it. The firſt Table muſt have the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſpect in our obedience to the ſecond. That is, the Love of God, and our regard of his Glory, commanded in the firſt Table (which is called, <hi>The firſt and great Commandment</hi>) muſt have the chief ſway in our hearts, to encline us to the duties of Love towards man, enjoyned in the ſecond Table; for we muſt love our Neighbour in the Lord, and for the Lord, and ſo the Love of God muſt have a conſtraining and over-ruling power over us; the Love of God muſt firſt move us to lay down our Lives for the Brethren, and then the Love of our Brethren, being (as it were) comprehended in our Love of God, muſt move us thereunto. — The Glory of God muſt be the principal end, that we muſt aim at, in doing good to others. So
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38435:54"/> eſpecially in this great fruit of Love, when we lay down our lives for them, then the good of our Brethren muſt be reſpected in the ſecond place, in as much as God is glorified in that good which they receive by that means. So then, when any do in Chriſtian Love lay down their Lives for their Brethren, they do not dye for them only, but for the Lord chiefly and principally. This the Apoſtle ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proveth to be required of Chriſtians, becauſe Chriſt hath ſhewed ſuch wonderful Love in laying down his Life tor us. This indeed is an Argument unanſwerable, but holdeth ſtrongly <hi>à majori,</hi> from the greater to the leſs. If Chriſt did lay down his Life for us, then ought we much more to lay down our lives for the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt was infinitely above us in Glory and Majeſty, yet laid he down his Life for us; much more ought we to lay down our Lives for the Brethren, who are of the ſame Mould with our ſelves by nature, and alſo partakers of the ſame pretious Faith by Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt being greatly offended by our ſins, laid down his Life for us being his enemies: much more ought we to lay down our Lives for thoſe who are not enemies, but Brethren, and that by the beſt bond, <hi>viz.</hi> the bond of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:38435:54"/>3. Chriſts Death for us, was a matter of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and abaſement to him who was the Prince of Life, and Lord of Glory: But our death for our Brethren is an advancement unto us. Some office and employment, which would be an abaſement, and diſhonour to a Prince, may be a great Honour and Preferment to a mean Subject. So in this caſe; Chriſt, though he were the Lord of Glory, the Prince of Life, yet was content to dye for us, though his Death were a great abaſement to him in regard of his infinite excellency and divine Majeſty. But for us, who are ſinful, and ſo mortal, and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to duſt, it is an advancement and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our death, when we are called to give our Lives for the Brethren.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>I Come now to the Condition ſuppoſed, that is, If we be called unto it: For this we muſt know, that many things are abſolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and all Chriſtians are to perform them in general without exception, ſuch as the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Beleeving and Repenting, and of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>forth fruits meet for repentance,</hi> which all Chriſtians ought to perform by vertue of their general Calling. —Some other are enjoyned too as well as the former, but not without a more ſpecial Calling. The duty of relieving the wants of others, is one of thoſe duties that is very much preſſed in the Scripture; ſcarce any, more; yet this is to be underſtood of thoſe that have a ſpecial calling to it, namely thoſe whom God hath enabled with outward means for this purpoſe, more or leſs. So the duty of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpel is ſtraitly enjoyned, but not to be exerciſed without a lawful Calling to the work of the Miniſtry. Of this latter ſort, is the duty of laying down our Lives for the Brethren, which is not to be exerciſed without a ſpecial calling. As for the madneſs of ſome fond Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whereof we read in the ancient Stories of the Church, who would force men to kill them
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38435:55"/> that they might become Martyrs, it could not but proceed from the ſuggeſtion of that wicked Spirit, who is a Murtherer from the beginning. Therefore this work of laying down our Lives for the Brethren, is not impoſed upon us, by vertue of our general calling, but muſt be done upon ſuppoſal of a ſpecial Call.</p>
                  <p>Yet thus much we know, that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and diſtinction to be made between the will and the deed in ſuch caſes. The will muſt be preſent with us, by vertue of our general calling, as we are Chriſtians; the deed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance it ſelf muſt not be undertaken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial calling: that is, As we are Chriſtians, and have given up our names to Chriſt, we muſt have our hearts ſo poſſeſſed with the Spirit of Brotherly and Chriſtian Love, in conformity to Chriſt and his Love, as that we muſt have a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing mind to undergo it, if the Lord ſhall call us to it. So the pooreſt Chriſtian that is ſo far from being able to give to another, that he needeth to receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> himſelf, yet muſt be ſo poſſeſſed with Chriſtian Love and Compaſſion, that he would give if he had ability. He muſt have a pitiful heart; ſuch an heart as would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his hand, if he had what to give. — So in this caſe, a Chriſtian muſt labour to bring his heart to be willing in Love to dye for his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. But for the actual performance of this work in laying down our lives for the Brethren,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:38435:56"/> it requireth a more ſpecial call. As the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Philippians, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to beleeve, but to ſuffer for his Name, Phil.</hi> 1.29. Where he ſheweth, that ſuffering is a thing given, a priviledg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon ſome Beleevers, whereunto all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are not called; that is, not in an eminent manner. Scarce any Beleever can live any long time in the world after his effectual calling and converſion, but that he ſhall ſuffer for the name of Chriſt in ſome kind or other: but to ſuffer in a more ſpecial and eminent degree, is given but to ſome, who are in a ſpecial manner called unto it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. We have a general<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Command to preſerve Life: We muſt labour to preſerve the Life of an Oxe, or an Aſſe when it is in danger, much more of a man: and if the Life of others, then our own alſo; inaſmuch as the Love we owe to our ſelves, is the rule of our love towards others. Therefore ſo far is it from being a duty impoſed upon us, to thruſt our ſelves raſhly and of our own heads into the mouth of death
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:38435:56"/> without a Calling, that we are bound not to deſire it, leſt we be found guilty of our own Blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To lay down our Life for the Brethren without a ſpecial Call and Warrant, may be a wrong to the Brethren, rather than a benefit; becauſe thereby we bereave our ſelves of doing them any further good in that way of Chriſtian Love, wherein we are to walk towards them here in the world by ſuffering death without a warrant: Yet when we have a Call, we muſt not give back under pretence, that we deſire to to do them good by our Lives, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the wiſdom of God, who calleth us to ſuffer, ſeeth, that thus dying for them, we ſhall more benefit them, and glorifie God, than we could by eſcaping death, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world among them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We cannot ſuffer death by the hands of Perſecutors for the Brethren, without the Sin of others, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe that ſhed our Blood. Now a Chriſtian without a Call from God, hath no warrant to give occaſion to others, wilfully to commit ſuch a bloody Sin: but when we are called to it, we muſt take heed, we do not ſin our ſelves, in giving back under an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pretence of being loth to give others an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of offending.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our bleſſed Savviour himſelf, although he came into the world, purpoſely to lay down
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:38435:57"/> his Life for the Brethren, yet did not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run upon his death, but did divers times ſhun the rage of his enemies, and even in his Infancy fled from <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty. And, when his hour was come, though he ſhewed himſelf many ways to be willing to lay down his Life, yet he did not thruſt himſelf into the hands of his enemies, but left them to contrive his death among themſelves, and ſo to take the guilt of his blood upon them. He could have ſaved the Prieſts that coſt they beſtowed upon <hi>Judas,</hi> to hire him to commit that moſt horrible treaſon. He could have prevented <hi>Judas,</hi> that he ſhould not have taken that booty, which coſt him ſo dear; but he let them take their courſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their malice. He ſuffered <hi>Judas</hi> to make his bargain, the High-Prieſts ſervants to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, and carry him to their Maſter: he would not of himſelf come among them, till they fetched, and carried him in the nature of a Priſoner.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> NOw then the queſtion is, What that Call is, which is ſuppoſed as a condition in this caſe, without which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not bound to lay down his Life for the Brethren?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> I anſwer, A Chriſtian may be called to this in ſuch Caſes, as do more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern God; and in ſuch as do more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern the Brethren.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe caſes as do more immediately concern God, in which we may be called to die for our Brethren, they may be divers, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When we are perſecuted for the Name and Goſpel of Chriſt, and are called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth, with apparent danger of death, in ſuch a caſe we are to lay down our lives for Chriſt: and in ſuch a caſe (in an inferiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) we are alſo to lay down our lives for the Brethren: inaſmuch as we ſhould rather chuſe to die, than to give any juſt occaſion of offence, or ſtumbling unto them, by denying the truth. And on the other ſide, we ſhould be content to dye for their encouragement in the profeſſion of the truth. Now, though this be a caſe that doth more directly and immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38435:58"/> God than our Brethren, yet it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our Brethren alſo in an inferiour reſpect. So in this regard, I think there were few of thoſe many thouſand martyrs which have ſuffered for Chriſt, but alſo they have ſuffered for their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: and in ſuch ſufferings they are to have regard to their Brethren, though principally to the Lord. Now we are called thus to ſuffer, when we are brought before thoſe in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and put to it, either to deny the truth, or to ſuffer death,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Preachers of the Goſpel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without danger of death declare the whole counſel of God in things needful to Salvation, they muſt be content to hazard their lives, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not to be faithful in that commiſſion, which the Lord hath put them in. This doth immediately concern the Glory of God, and the diſcharge of their Conſciences toward him: But it doth alſo concern the Glory of God in an inferiour degree; and they muſt refuſe both to deliver any unſound Doctrine to them, to the endangering of their Souls, and abhor to keep back any neceſſary truth from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their own lives ſhould be in apparent danger by that means.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>SECT. VII.</head>
                  <p>ON the other ſide there are caſes, that do more immediately concern the Brethren, wherein we may be called to lay down our lives for them; yet in theſe our principal aim muſt be at the Glory of God. As for Example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we be put to it to confeſs ſome things by others of the Godly, which may bring them into danger through the malice of wicked men. In this caſe we ſhould rather dye than hurt them by ſuch confeſſions, leſt we be acceſſory to the miſchief, which by that means the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are like to bring upon them. I have read of one <hi>Firmus,</hi> an holy Biſhop of <hi>Tageſta,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Countrey, in <hi>Africk,</hi> who when the Emperor (not then a Chriſtian) required de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, or (at leaſt) the diſcovery of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which he had with great care hidden from the Tyrant, reſolutely anſwered, <hi>Nee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, nee mentiar,</hi> I will neither lye, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray my Brother: from which reſolution, no torments then inflicted (which were many and ſharp) could draw or enforce him. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his acts and monuments tells us of <hi>Cuthbert Simpſon,</hi> who being Deacon of the Proteſtant Congregation in <hi>London,</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38435:59"/> was apprehended and charged to diſcover the names of thoſe that were Members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which he utterly refuſed to do, and would not yeeld to do it by any torture, but conſtantly ſuffered death, and cruel wrackings alſo before his death; inſomuch that bloody <hi>Bonner</hi> did openly in the hearing of divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, extoll him, for his wonderful patience. So, if Chriſtians living under Popiſh Perſecutors, ſhould be driven to meet together in Ships or Woods, or other private places to perform the Worſhip of God together, if any Chriſtian ſhould be privy thereunto, although himſelf might eſcape untoucht in Body, Goods, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon condition only, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and diſcover them, he ought rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſpoiling of all his Goods, or the loſs of Liberty, or of Life, rather than ſerve the malice of the Adverſaries, in laying open the Brethren unto the cruelty of malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When any neceſſary duty is required at our hands for the good of the Brethren, and of the people of God, which we are bound to perform, although with hazard of our lives, we muſt be content to put our lives in our hands, and not withdraw our hand from helping them in ſuch a caſe. So thoſe that are in any Countrey cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the wars in defence of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope and his adherents, or againſt the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:38435:59"/> Turk, againſt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and to ſtand up in defence of the Goſpel. In like manner thoſe that are called by any ſpecial relation to others, or any ſpecial office to ſupply others in time of the Peſtilence, or other infectious diſeaſes, ought in Love to hazard their Lives for their good, and not be wanting to them; unleſs in ſome Caſes, when by helping ſome they are like to hinder many more.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is generally held, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are not tyed to viſit thoſe that are ſick of contagious diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would make their people to ſhun th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But yet, where there are divers Miniſters in the ſame place, I ſhould conceive it fitting, that one or more according to the number of the infected, ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this work, and that the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Congregation ſhould be diſcharged by others. As when the Plague was at <hi>Geneva</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s time, there being divers Miniſters in in the City, three of them (whereof <hi>Calvin</hi> was one) offered themſelves to this ſervice; and ſo it was to be decided, by <hi>Lot,</hi> which of the three ſhould be the man. Such caſes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may happen concerning the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Godly, who are impriſoned or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38435:60"/> by Popiſh Perſecutors; as many were in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days. In a word; When any neceſſary duty, which we owe to the people of God, may be likely to endanger our Lives, we muſt not ſhrink back to ſave our Lives.</p>

Our Saviour laid down his Life for their Salvation, we muſt do ſo alſo. St. <hi>Paul</hi> gladly endured any thing for the Elects ſake; he could wiſh himſelf to be an <hi>Anathema,</hi> a Curſe for the Jews his Brethren: and <hi>Moſes</hi> would be blotted out of the Book of Life, that the Iſraelites might live in the preſence of God. A miſerable wretch St. <hi>Paul</hi> was for Chriſts ſake, and for the Salvatioh of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. <hi>We are fools, weak deſpiſed, naked, hungry, buffeted, perſecuted, made the off-ſcouring of the world.</hi> God makes the like Covenant with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38435:60"/> us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did with the two Tribes and half, which dwelt on the other ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> that they ſhould go in before their Brethren, and fight for them, to expell the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and when they had placed their Brethren in <hi>Canaan,</hi> then they were to return and enjoy their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances. Thus muſt we hazard our Lives to bring others to Heaven, if called unto it, and neglect our own Lives, that others might enjoy the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> together with us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe this will wonderfully confirm the Brethren in the truth delivered to them, and proteſſed by them: otherwiſe our Cowardice and Apoſtacy may cauſe them to waver, and draw them off from the ways of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

St. <hi>Baſil</hi> tells us, how forty
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:38435:61"/> Martyrs did encourage one another to dye for Chriſt and his Goſpel.

                  <p>Let all then that would be acknowledged for Gods Children, labour for ſo much power of Chriſtian Love, as may diſpoſe their hearts, to be content to reſign up their Lives for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the good of others.

                  <p>THere is one great Office of Love which we muſt perform one to another, even thoſe that are not called to lay down their Lives for the Brethren, muſt do this, that is, to bear one anothers Burdens. <hi>Bear ye one anothers burdens, and ſo fulfill the law of Chriſt.

Calvin</hi> ſaith, That Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt ſhew their Humanity one to another, which teacheth men to afford mutual help in their neceſſities by <hi>bearing one anothers burdens.</hi> This duty concerneth every Chriſtian; it is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38435:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> not only the duty of ſtrong Chriſtians to bear the burdens of the weak, but alſo the weak may, and muſt bear the Burdens of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Both have their Burdens; the ſtrong hath his, the weak hath his; both need help and eaſe, both are ſubject to faint under their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; therefore we muſt <hi>bear one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> even that which lieth heavy, and preſſeth down our Souls and Bodies. There are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burdens, and inward Burdens.</p>
                  <p>As to outward Burdens; thoſe that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility muſt be merciful to their Brethren who are in want. St. <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to charge them that are rich in this world, that <hi>they be not high-minded</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.18. Do then the rich bear the Burdens of the poor, when they are rich and plentiful in giving to thoſe that are in need? <hi>To do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well-pleaſed, Heb.</hi> 13.16. It is given in charge, as a thing eſpecially to be remembred, and by no means to be forgotten. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſheweth, that thoſe who are able, and relieve not their poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, are void of the Love of God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20.21. <hi>If a man ſay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar; for he that loveth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? And this Commandment have we

And the ſame Law of Love that commandeth us to love, requireth us to love our Brethren and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours alſo. But with what kind of Love? that the Apoſtle ſheweth in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. not a Love made up of words, or rooted in the tongue, but a Love that is Love indeed, and Love in truth: a Love ſeated in the heart, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorth the fruits of Love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here it may be demanded, if the want of a compaſſionate heart and hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the needy in thoſe that are able, be an Argument of the want of Love to God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the other ſide, forwardneſs in relieving others, be always a ſure ſign of one that truly loveth God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> I anſwer, No: for a man may bear the Burdens of the needy, and be helpful to them in many other reſpects, although he hath not the Love of God dwelling in him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

Therefore this alone, unleſs it be joyned with other Graces, and fruits of Grace in an holy Converſation, is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument, that a mans heart is poſſeſſed with a true and ſincere Love of God: ſo that the want of this Chriſtian Compaſſion and its fruits, is enough to prove him that hath this worlds goods, not to have the Love of God dwelling in him: but the practice of this duty alone, is not ſufficient to prove a man to have the Love of God in him.

                  <p>NOw as to inward burdens, I will ſhew, wherein Chriſtians bearing of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burdens conſiſteth. In general, it is to eaſe and refreſh the drooping Spirits, groaning, ſighing, and mourning under the burden of Sin; this is (as the Prophet ſpeaks in another caſe) To looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undoe the heavy burdens, to let the oppreſſed go free and to break every yoke.

                  <p n="1">1, When we pray for them, in their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as earneſtly, as importunately, as affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, as for our own ſouls burthened with the ſame Load.

Cry to heaven for pardon, and you give preſent eaſe to one another: pray for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and ye make each others ſins ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Feather, which before were as heavy as a mountain of Lead.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we can mourn with them, and for them, lament their iniquities, and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their ſins, as for our own; when we can bow down heavily as though they were our
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:38435:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> Brethren, and behave our ſelves as one that mourneth for his mother. <hi>Moſes</hi> by his prayers and tears did bear the burden of the whole Camp of Iſrael. Mutual Humiliation for one another, brings mutual eaſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we labour the Converſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of one another. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.19.20. <hi>He that converteth a ſinner, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall bide a multitude of ſins;</hi> here is Salvation from death and ſin, from multitudes of ſins, a deliverance from two inſupportable burdens, which have broke the backs of all the damned caſt-aways.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we direct them to a right courſe of obtaining and regaining the Favour of God, from our own experiences. As men who have been troubled with any pain, will tell thoſe who have been labouring with the ſame, by what means they had preſent eaſe: What Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, what Oyntments, what Salves they uſed? make tryal of the ſame, and ye will find preſent eaſe. Thus when Chriſtians, who experimentally know the burthen of ſin, the horror of guilt, ſhall communicated their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and directions; This I did, and I obtained pardon, I humbled my ſoul, I taſted, I prayed, I reformed, I departed from evil, and the Lord gave me preſent eaſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When we apply the comfortable promiſes of the Goſpel to them: Seeſt thou a fellow-Chriſtian
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:38435:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſtian bitterly bewailing his ſin, full of ſhame and ſorrow for his ſin, going hither and thither like a deſolate forlorn man, fearing his eſtate and condition, queſtioning his Salvation, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the thoughts of Hell, then muſt thou apply Goſpel-promiſes: to ſuch a one. The truth is, the promiſes do belong to none but to burdened ſinners; <hi>Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden, and I will eaſe you,</hi> This is to pour Oyl into their wounds, this is to bind up the broken in heart, when we aptly apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to them. Doſt thou hear them complain of the greatneſs of ſin, apply that place <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.</hi> Chriſt came to ſave the chief of ſinners. Doſt thou hear them complain of the multitudes of their ſins; apply that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. The Lord <hi>&amp;c. forgiving iniquities, trangreſſions, and ſins.</hi> Do they complain of their miſery? apply thou the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of mercy. Do they complain of their unworthineſs? apply the promiſes of free Grace; tell them, that God will freely heal all their backſlidings.</p>

                  <p>THe reaſon why we are to bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burdens is, becauſe in ſo doing we ſhall fulfil the Law of Chriſt: it is the Law of Chriſt, it is the command of Chriſt, that we ſhould bear one anothers burdens, that Law which compels you to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. Yes, becauſe in commanding us to love one another, he commandeth us to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny office of Love and Humanity one to another, whereof this of bearing one anothers burdens, is none of the leaſt duties of Chriſtian mutual Love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe our Love of one to another muſt conform to Chriſts Love, which he ſhewed unto us. Now herein Chriſt did commend his Love unto us, in that he was pleaſed to bear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:38435:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Lord Jeſus bore our burdens for us, we had been for ever cruſhed, and ſunk down under them. Shall Chriſt bear our Burdens, and ſhall not we bear one anothers burdens, and ſhew our ſelves therein to be followers of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe this duty is one of the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of our obedience unto Chriſt: obſerve the words <hi>ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt:</hi> it is not a perfect, but <hi>ſolidum complementum,</hi> a ſolid, or ſubſtantial fulfilling of the Law of Chriſt. It is not ſaid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſincere performances, that we fulfil the Law of Chriſt; it is not ſaid of thy praying, thy hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that thou doſt fulfil the Law of Chriſt, but of this duty of Love: <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law:</hi> Bearing of one anothers burdens (which is an eminent act of Love) is the fulfilling the Law of Chriſt. Without this, all other offices of Love, are but ſlight, ſuperficial acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: he that doth not do this, <hi>nihil habet,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) he hath nothing of a man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Chriſtian, nothing of a diſciple of Chriſt, nothing of Chriſtian Love in him.</p>
                  <p>There is a Sect, not long ſince riſen among us, calling themſelves <hi>High-attainers,</hi> boaſting that they have attained to perfection of Holineſs, and therefore need not the help of ordinances. But theſe deluded wretches do come as ſhort of perfection, as the Earth doth of Heaven: but now thoſe who do Chriſtianly bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I know there may be ſtrong Love in mens hearts toward ſome perſons, without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Love of God, and the ſpirit of Regeneration; and this Love may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commendable in it; but it is nothing in reſpect of Gods gracious acceptation: ſuch men do rather Love in obedience to the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; than in obedience to the Law, or Goſpel of Chriſt; therefore their Love loſeth accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Lord. I ſay, they love in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of Nature; for men have ſome parts of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remain written in their hearts,<note place="margin">How men love in obedience to the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſheweth even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gentiles, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.15 which Law I take to be more than the light of Nature, for otherwiſe (methinketh) it ſhould rather be called the Doctrine, or the inſtructions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than a Law; for a Law carrieth Authority with it, and a binding power; but a light, or a doctrine doth but only ſhew and teach. But that which was written by Nature in the hearts of the Gentiles, the Apoſtle ſaith, was written as a Law, and ſo it carried a kind of Authority over their Hearts and Conſciences; not only ſhewing them what ſhould be done, but alſo enclining and bowing their ſpirits unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t. So at this day, this law of Nature may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:38435:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> the hearts of many (as a law) to love their Neighbors; and they do it in obedience to this law of Nature, that is, they yield to this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enclination of their hearts, and according to it do love ſome perſons, whom their natures do encline them to love, until this Law be countermanded by a ſtronger law, the law of Sin and Corruption, enclining the heart to caſt off love, and to entertain bitterneſs of ſpirit, or the like, and until it be over-born by outward occaſions, which tend to quench Love. For this law of Nature is weak, and ſoon loſeth its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and command; I mean, ſo far as it hath any thing good in it, ſo far as it is a broken piece (as it were) of the Image of God. But if we take the law of Nature for Nature corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is the law of Sin: that is very ſtrong, and hath a great command over the heart, and is hardly reſiſted. Now then they that have any commendable love in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others in their natural eſtate, they do but herein follow the inclination of their hearts, which is the ſame that I ſaid before, that they do it in obedience to the law of Nature, not in obedience to the law of Chriſt.

                  <p n="1">1. We muſt love our own Souls next to Jeſus Chriſt. God is to be loved above all as the chief and ſupream good, and our own Souls next as being more worth than a whole world: and if the love of any thing ſhould ſtand between God and our Souls, we muſt hate that thing as our deadly enemy, that ſeeks to rob us of our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good.</p>

                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:38435:67"/>2. We muſt love our Neighbors ſoul next to our own ſoul, above our own bodies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Among our Neighbours we muſt love thoſe that are moſt godly, the excellent of the earth, thoſe that excell in goodneſs; <hi>In them is all my delight,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> God's Jewels muſt be in our account moſt precious; one pearl is more worth than a million of pibbles: God loveth all men, but the riches of his lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he giveth to his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Among the godly thoſe of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to be eſpecially beloved. <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem. They ſhall proſper that love thee,</hi> Pſal. 122.6. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could even wiſh himſelf accurſed for his Countrymen the <hi>Jews:</hi> and for their ſakes <hi>Moſes</hi> could even be blotted out of the book of life. As Chriſt came from the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo he came to ſeek the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Among them I am to love thoſe who are my Kindred above others who are not: Nature calls for love, but Grace calls for more.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are in a ſpecial manner to love thoſe of our Family. A Chriſtian is to labour to make his ally, his friend, but eſpecially his Wife and Children, ſuch as may be lovely and acceptable. How did <hi>David</hi> mourn for his ſon <hi>Abſalom?</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> pray for <hi>Iſhmael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Above all a man is to love his Wife. <hi>A man ſhall leave his father and his mother, and ſhall
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38435:68"/> cleave unto his Wife, and they ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> Gen. 2.24. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> Epheſ. 5.25. This is the order of our Love.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Here it may be demanded; Seeing ſpecial love is due to the Saints next to Chriſt, becauſe they make one body with him; am I bound to love godly men that are not my kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, above my wicked kindred; whether I am to love a godly ſtranger before a wicked Wife or Child?</p>
                  <p>Reſp. 1. There is a double Love: <hi>Amor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probationis &amp; complacentiae; Amor optationis vel deſiderii:</hi> a love of approbation and complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; a love of wiſhing or deſire. I may love a Stranger that is godly with the love of delight and approbation, for his graces ſhining in him, more than I do thoſe that are neer to me that are wicked. Thus <hi>Jonathan</hi> did love godly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> more than he did wicked <hi>Saul</hi> that was his Father: but with the love of deſire and wiſh of the Salvation of my VVife and Children, and Kindred, wiſhing them grace and glory; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I may ſhew more love to my wicked VVife, Husband, and Children, than to godly Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:38435:68"/> It is true, in regard of wiſhing Salvation, I am to love a godly Stranger and my Kindred alike, but in regard of the earneſt deſire of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I may more earneſtly deſire the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Wife than theirs. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> did earneſtly deſire the Salvation of wicked <hi>Iſhmael. Oh that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſtian love is not meaſured by carnal effects, but being ſpiritual love, it is moſt ſhewn in Spiritual things, as in holy cleaving of hearts together, in mutual prayers, in mutual comforting, in mutual delighting in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gifts and graces; in mutual exhortation of one another to love and good works. With this love I may love a godly Stranger more than any of my neareſt Kindred that are not godly, when as my natural affection may be ſtronger to my wicked Kindred than to godly Strangers, as in providing for them the things of this Life. I muſt nouriſh my Wife and Children, when as I may ſuffer Saints to periſh with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, if I have not ſufficient means to relieve both: but if I have ſufficient means for both, then muſt I feed an hungry Saint, and cloath a naked <hi>Lazarus.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what if ſome of my Kinred are godly, but poor; others are wicked, but rich: ſome of my Children are godly, but are not ſo witty and handſom, and ſo induſtrious for the world as others of my Children that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38435:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> are wicked; What ſhall I do in this daſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> I anſwer, Thy godly Kinred, be they never ſo poor, and yet in an equal relation with thy rich Kinred that are wicked, are to have thy ſpecial Love. And if thou doſt not ſhew more Love to ſuch, thou doſt not love Grace but Riches: ſo likewiſe for Children, <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Joſeph</hi> more than all his other Sons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more godly: Wo to that Father that ſhall diſhearten a godly Child, and give more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto, and be more fond over a rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Prodigal, a ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> What is this but for a man to love ſin in his Child more than godlineſs; the Image of the Devil more than the Image of God? It is true, that where there are more relations of Kinred, Neighbourhood, Co-heirſhip of Grace, and the like, there Love admitteth of multiplication and encreaſe, but this draweth not the Lover from God, who is the Author of thoſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Rule of Love alſo. Carnal Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers firſt pleaſe their fancy, and then their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt act, let the object be what it will: to them godly or ungodly are much at one: they make no difference between the houſhold of Faith, and the fraternity of evil men: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God make a difference between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> yet they will make none: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe Sons of God, that ſeeing the Daughters of men to be fair, took them Wives

               <p>THe next thing I am come to do, is to ſhew, When a man may be ſaid to love the Children of God. To this end, conſider theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. True Chriſtian Love to the people of God is a peculiar kind of Love, whereby a man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them as they are the Children of God, and as Brethren, be they Strangers or Acquaintance, Kinred or not; rich or poor, mean or mighty, honourable or baſe, it is all one, if they be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſons. In natural Love, there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Love of a Brother towards a Brother, diſtinct from the Love of a Neighbour: a man may have a natural Love to a Neighbour, but another kind of peculiar Love to a Brother. So if a man do love the Children of God as he ought, he loveth them with a peculiar Love, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey are the Children of God. A man may lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nother, for ſome good quality of Art or Nature, though he be not a Child of God; but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:38435:70"/> there muſt be a peculiar Love to the Children of God, though there be not the ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Art or Nature in them: he muſt love them as made near unto him by Grace, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him in partaking of the ſame precious Faith; he muſt love them for Holineſs ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fear the Lord, and follow after righteouſneſs. Some men have no peculiar Love to the people of God, but their peculiar and familiar Love is for ſome natural perſons, who ſuit beſt with their carnal affections: theſe are their boſom-Friends. This is a ſign of unſound Love, when a mans moſt intimate Friends are wicked perſons; although he may beſtow a good look upon ſome of the people of God, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carry himſelf ſomewhat fairly towards them. If they ſeem to love ſome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, it is for ſome other reſpect, and not becauſe they are the Children of God: it may be there is ſome ſpecial gift in them, either of Body or Mind, common to them with natural men, and for this they love them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delight in their company; but as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good men, not ſo qualified (yet as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere as the former, and as rich in Grace) they do not affect them.</p>
               <p>He that loveth Religion in a man becauſe he is rich, or comely, or a man of parts, &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, though he be all glorious within, he doth not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:38435:70"/> love a godly man. And as <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid of two men (one was his Friend, the other was his Flatterer), <hi>Hic amat Regem, ile Alexandrum;</hi> This man loveth me becauſe I am a King, and can prefer him; but, that man loveth <hi>Alexander,</hi> he loveth my very perſon. So it may be ſaid of ſuch as love Religious perſons, becauſe rich or noble. <hi>Hic amat divitias, honores, ille amat religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> Theſe men love riches and honours, not religion; only he that loveth a righteous man <hi>in nomine juſti,</hi> becauſe he is righteous, he loveth the godly with a peculiar love.</p>
               <p>So the true love by which the Children of God do love each other, is towards Strangers whom they never ſaw, nor are like to ſee, when they hear of their Graces, and of their zeal and forwardneſs in the ways of God, and for his glory; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was affectionate towards thoſe of the godly, who had not ſeen his face in the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then doth a man truly love the godly, when he can love all Saints, as well as ſome; and this floweth from the former. If I love a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ild of God becauſe a child of God, I muſt love all the children of God. <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia.</hi> If I love gold, becauſe gold, I love all gold; ſo if I love grace, becauſe grace, I cannot but love grace in all. If I love the Image of God in one, I muſt needs carry the ſame affection to all that have this Image.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38435:71"/> There is the ſame ground, reaſon, motive and object in all Saints, as well as in one particular Saint. To love one Saint, and not another, is to make ſpiritual love carnal, a divided, a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> for <hi>while one ſaith, I am of Paul, another ſaith, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal.</hi> So when men ſhall ſay, I love ſuch a man, he is a good man, but cannot endure the name of another godly man; their love is carnal. He that loveth not all Saints, loveth no Saint at all; he that loveth not the poor Saint as well as the rich, the low and mean Saints as well as the noble and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable, he doth not truly love any. There is great reaſon why we ſhould love all Saints as well as one, be their outward conditions never ſo contrary. God the father loveth all his Saints alike. All the Saints have an equal ſhare in the love of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſhed his blood for all alike; he giveth his merits and righteouſneſs to all alike: Yea, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf calleth all the Saints his brethren, even the meaneſt of his Saints. The heart of the meaneſt Chriſtian is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as the heart of the moſt honourable, and ſhall not we love all whom the Lord thus loveth? Godly love is like the Center in the midſt of a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or circle, which hath an equal reſpect to all parts of the circle; ſo true Chriſtian love hath reſpect to all parts of the circle, ſo true
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38435:71"/> Chriſtian love hath reſpect to all Saints equally.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When they go beyond us in grace, when they excell us in holineſs, when we love them the more we ſee them excell us in grace and in all ſpiritual gifts, whatever relation they have unto us, yea though their gifts and graces ſhould eclypſe ours, yet then if we can as truly rejoyce in their gifts, as if we our ſelves had them, and do more entirely love them, by how much the more we ſee thoſe gifts and graces ſhining in them, this is true Chriſtian love: like that of <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 11.29. when one came, and told them, that <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> prophecyed, <hi>Moſes</hi> was glad to hear it: <hi>Would God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all the Lord's people were Prophets!</hi> Are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as good, or better than I am, would God that he or they, and all others were better than I. Only he loveth the Saints truly, that can love them for their graces, and the more grace, the more to love them. Let it ſatisfie thee, that thou art a door-keeper in God's houſe, although thou art not made high Prieſt to enter into the holy of holies; it is well that thou art admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Chriſt's School, although thou art not placed in the higheſt form: it is well that thou art a beloved diſciple of Chriſt, although thou haſt not the ſame priviledg with St. <hi>John</hi> to lie always in the boſom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When we can love the Saints conſtantly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:38435:72"/> at all times, as well as at one time, when the Church of God is overwhelmed with troubles, and nothing but ſtormy clouds hang over the heads of God's people, then to love them as in the ſereneſt calm, when the Church enjoyeth peace and quiet round about, when there are no fears, troubles, nor perſecutions, this is the man that loveth the godly. Doth the ſtate of a Chriſtian alter and decay, yet thy charity doth not decay? Is a Chriſtian friend fallen into diſgrace with the world, yet thou doſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make much of him? Is he perſecuted every where, yet thy love followeth him? Is he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into poverty and neceſſity, yet thy love fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not for all this: certainly thy love to the godly is a peculiar love. It is not affliction that ſhall divide the Soul of <hi>Jonathan</hi> from the Soul of <hi>David.</hi> True Chriſtian love owneth the people of God in all conditions; it uniteth and knitteth the heart to the children of God, and maketh a man one with them, and ſo maketh their caſe ours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When we can heartily love godly men, when they moſt of all reprove us, check us,<note place="margin">The Rebukes of friend are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Flatterings of a foe; and he that loveth with austerity is better than he that killeth with delicacy.</note> admoniſh us, and as gladly receive an holy reproof as a kindneſs from them, <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

This often times turneth the love of wicked men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hatred, who pretend love as long as the godly are ſilent at their evil ways, but if they begin to reprove, they will ceaſe to love. Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> dealt with <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Mutual reproof is a ſign of true Chriſtian love to each other; if thou loveſt a child of God, love him when he reproveth thee, as when he doth not.</p>

The hatred of the world againſt the godly is no new, nor ſtrange thing; it is a thing not to be wondered or marvelled at, <hi>marvel not my brethren, if the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38435:73"/> world hate you.

                  <p>The Lord himſelf hath ſounded the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of War between the world and the godly, how then can they but take the Alarum, and prepare themſelves to Battle? not, that the Lord hath either commanded the world to fight againſt his people, or that he hath infuſed any malice into the men of the world, but that he having put his Spirit into the hearts of the godly, &amp; made them partakers of his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath thereby made them contrary to the world, even as Light to Darkneſs; whereupon neceſſarily followeth the hatred and enmity of the world againſt them. We ſee the truth of this in the malice of <hi>Cain</hi> againſt <hi>Abel; Iſhmael</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iſaac; Eſau</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob;</hi> three pair of Brethren in ſeveral ages.

This hath been the courſe of the world from age to age. Thus did the <hi>Caldeans</hi> ſhew their malice to <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> accuſing them to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that they might be thrown into the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for ſhunning of Idolatry. Thus did the Courtiers of <hi>Darius</hi> ſhew their bitter and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38435:74"/> malice againſt righteous <hi>Daniel,</hi> for praying three times a day to his God, craftily circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the King himſelf (not privy to their drift) to ſign an unlawful Decree, by which <hi>Daniel</hi> was enſnared, that he might be caſt into the Lions Den. So <hi>Haman</hi> ſhewed his malice againſt <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and the whole Church of the Jews, ſeeking their utter ruin. <hi>Tobijah</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> were carried with the like malicious ſpirit againſt the Church, and againſt the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the worſhip of God at Jeruſalem. <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes</hi> was full of malice and rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church. So <hi>Herod,</hi> the chief Prieſts, and the unbelieving Jews alſo in the Apoſtles times: the Roman Emperors, and after them the Roman Biſhops have continued this enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and many other Popiſh Princes.

But the Devil having uſurped a Kingdom over the world by Gods permiſſion, ever ſince he conquered it in the Garden, and ſo eontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Tyranny over it, until Chriſt at the laſt day ſhall utterly and finally deſtroy his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it is no matter of wonder, no new and ſtrange thing, that the world which is in ſubjection under him, doth continue to hate the people of God. He is the Arch-enemy of God, and he will inſpire hatred and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Children of God, into the hearts of thoſe that are in ſubjection to him. As it is ſaid of <hi>Cain,</hi> he was of that wicked one, and ſlew his Brother, &amp;c. ſo it may be ſaid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſecutors, and enemies in their ſeveral times; <hi>Haman</hi> was of that wicked one; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>

The want of love is the deficient cauſe (as it were) of all the fruits and effects of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and hatred.

So then, either ye muſt love out of a pure heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly, or elſe the Lord will account you as haters of your Brethren. Our Saviour made no middle-way between love and hatred in the ordering of our hearts and affections towards enemies; but when he corrected the Phariſees gloſs, which was this, [<hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and hate thine enemy.</hi>] He ſaith, <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies,</hi> &amp;c.

So that not to love thoſe whom we ought to love, is to hate: So then, as we will avoid the damnable ſin of hatred, we muſt labour to be poſſeſſed of the grace of love, and that principally to the Children of God, and to all the Children of God, high and low, rich and poor, of better or of meaner gifts and parts; and on the other ſide to be poſſeſſed with hearty love towards all men in general, and in particular toward thoſe that have done us injuries and unkindneſſes, otherwiſe we are haters of them.</p>

How great then is the love of God toward his children, he will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that any love him, who hate them. When the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> told our Saviour; we have one father, even God, he anſwered, <hi>If God were your father, ye would love me; for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forth, and came from God, neither come I of my ſelf, but he ſent me,</hi> Joh. 8.41, 42.

If God were your father, ye would love them that do moſt of all labour to honour and pleaſe God, and are moſt careful not to ſin againſt him. Such is God's love to his people, that he taketh none for his own, that do not love them. There be many that ſay, they love God, and yet love not his children. Well! the Lord will none of thy love, unleſs it be ſuch as maketh thee alſo to love his children.

This the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens ſaw by the light of Nature, therefore one of them ſaid, <hi>Quem oderunt, periiſſe expetunt,</hi> whom men do hate, his death they do deſire. Now what is this but murder? It is true! that in reſpect of the perſon hated, the hurt done to him by hating him is much leſs than when he is actually murdered, and his blood ſpilt. It is true alſo, that the actual commiſſion of murder in outward act doth add much to the guilt of his conſcience that hateth his brother, becauſe there is both the inward hatred or murder of the heart, and the outward cruel act of murder added to it; there is the beginning, and the conſummation, the accompliſhing and finiſhing of this bloody ſin. But yet the inward malice and hatred of the heart, which maketh thoſe that harbour malice in their hearts, to wiſh the death and deſtruction of thoſe they hate, or to rejoyce in it, is murder in the ſight of God. Men that have malice feſtering in their hearts againſt others, cauſing a deſire of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may hold their hands from ſhedding of

And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, they are not reſtrained from murther by Love in any degree.

As the Child is in the Fathers Loyus ere it be born or conceived, ſo murther is in the Bowels of Malice before it is brought ſorth. As poyſon is in the young Brood of the Viper before it is able to put forth the ſting; ſo murther lyeth a breeding in the womb of Malice and Hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it break forth into Blood. Malice maketh a bloody Heart, and Murther maketh bloody hands. Murther is oftentimes the effect of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied

                  <p n="3">3. The Scripture calleth it Murther, to ſhew how great a Sin hatred of Godlineſs is. <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſputing what was the greateſt ſin as a man man could commit againſt his Neighbour, his reſolution was, that <hi>Odium proximi eſt graviſſimum peccatorum,</hi> it was Hatred of our Neighbour. Much more grievous it is, when a man ſhall hate any one, becauſe he followeth the thing that good is, and hateth a man becauſe he laboureth to be like unto God. To ſhed mans Blood, who was made after the Image of God, and to do that murther that ever was committed with the leaſt degree of malice that any was, is a moſt fearful and damnable ſin: but I conceive, that there may be a greater ſin committed in harbouring abundance of malice and bitterneſs in the heart, though without Bloodſhed, than in ſome Caſes, when Blood is unlawfully ſpilt. In the malice of our powder-Traytors, this is apparent, which though by the Providence of God, it was reſtrained from ſhedding of Blood, was far more grievous than many an act of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38435:83"/> murther, which hath been committed. But beſides this, when men do neither actually ſhed Blood, nor purpoſe and plot bloodſhed, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their malice may be more ſinful than ſome acts of Murther. I doubt not, but that many a man ſinneth far more in malice againſt his Neighbour, than <hi>David</hi> in killing <hi>

Now there may be a more ſtrong bent of the heart againſt the Law of Love in deep-ſetled malice long continued in the heart and ſoul, full of impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable rage and bitterneſs, than in ſome acts of murther. The hurt done to a mans Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is incomparably greater in murthering him, than that which is done by meer malice concealed, and kept cloſe in the heart, be it never ſo great. But the greatneſs of ſin, (I ſuppoſe) though againſt the ſecond Table, is not always to be meaſured by the hurt done to a Neighbour, but by the greater or leſſer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Law of Love. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that ſome men going on with reſtleſs malice and bitterneſs of ſpirit againſt their Neighbour, may be more guilty in the ſight of God, than ſome others that have committed that fearful ſin of murther; ſo great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a ſin is the ſin of malice before the Lord, who is Love.</p>

So <hi>Jonathan</hi> dealt plainly with his Father <hi>Saul,</hi> laying open the greatneſs of his ſin in hating <hi>David</hi> to the death, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had had Grace to have made uſe of his Sons faithful dealing with him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſpake good of David unto Saul his Father, and ſaid unto him, let not the King ſin againſt his ſervant, againſt David, becauſe he hath not ſinned againſt thee, and becauſe his works have been to thee-ward very good. For he did put his life in his hand, and ſlew the Philiſtine, and the Lord wrought a great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all Iſrael.

If malice be murther, when injuries are received; how much more when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have laboured to do us good? if thou haſt hated any for croſſing thee in an evil way in word or deed, thou haſt ſinned in an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and haſt cauſe to be greatly humbled for it.</p>

Let us alſo examine, how our hearts have been ſtirred leſs or more in hatred, or bitter affections againſt any others; for, there is great difference of degrees in this as in other ſins: how hardly we have been brought to reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, how implacable? What bitterneſs hath broken forth out of our hearts in words or actions againſt them? what offence, or evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we have given to others by theſe means? and accordingly ſhould we charge our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences before the Lord. I fear many do very lightly paſs over this ſin of malice, eſpecially it having not much ſhewed it ſelf openly, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the moſt part part layen in the depths of their malicious hearts. Owe nothing then to any man, but to love one another: Do not in malice think, that thou oweſt ill will, or an ill-turn to any, but that thou oweſt love to all, malice to none: for whoſoever hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a murtherer, and ye know that no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer hath eternal Life abiding in him.</p>

This ſheweth what a God he is to us, and every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture findeth him to be a loving God, a loving Father. As the Sun is Light, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Light, and gives Light to the Stars of Heaven, and to all ſublunary things; ſo God is Love it ſelf, and the Fountain of all Love: he filleth the Angels in Heaven with Love, he filleth the Saints on earth with mutual and ſpiritual Love; and the natural Love and Affection that are in men one to another, are ſparks and rays of Gods Love: all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are objects of his Love, every Creature of God is good, therefore beloved of God. Do ye think God would vouchſafe to call himſelf by the Name of Love, if there were not a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful excellency in Love? now, <hi>he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him:</hi> he that embraceth the Love of God by Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon unfeignedly loveth God and his Brethren,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:38435:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> dwelling, continuing, or abiding in this Love, he continueth or abideth in God, and God in him. If in any Love it be true, That the Soul is where it loveth, it is moſt true in this Love of a Child of God to his heavenly Father, and to all the Saints: his Soul is with God, with Chriſt, his Beloved in Heaven, and abideth in him. This our Saviour knew full well, when he taught us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>Lay not up for your ſelves Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures on earth, but lay up for your ſelves Treaſures in Heaven:</hi> for where your Treaſures are, there will your hearts be alſo. His delight alſo is in the Saints that are on the earth in thoſe that excel in Grace and Holineſs. One that was full of holy Love was wont to anſwer all queſtions therewith. Whence cameſt thou? <hi>from Love:</hi> Whither goeſt thou? <hi>to Love:</hi> Where dwelleſt thou? <hi>in Love.</hi> God is ſuch a ones dwelling-place, his home, his reſting-place, and Chriſt is the Door by which he entreth into this dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, by Chriſt he entreth and dwelleth in God. Now malice makes men moſt like unto the Devil, whoſe continual exerciſe is malice, and malicious practices againſt God and man. Such was his helliſh malice, that ſeeing man in happineſs, and the favour of God, he entiſed the woman, and by her the man, to that ſin and rebellion, which brought all mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a moſt miſerable Condition: and what is his continual practice, but to ſin, and to draw men
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38435:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> and women into ſin? Now thoſe that harbour malice in their hearts, they are in a ſpecial ſort like to Satan, when it is againſt the perſons, not the ſins of others only. Malice is properly a ſetled Hatred, a rancour of heart, by which men are provoked to deal ſpitefu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Can a wicked man (as a wicked man) have a greater enemy than ſuch as will not give them Elbow room in their ſins, but croſs them in their Prophaneſs? When the water-courſes are ſtopt, the waters ſwell high; ſo when the godly man laboureth to dam up the courſes of ungodlineſs, the wicked ſwell with hatred againſt ſuch.

Now the Devil is ever ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the wicked to hate the godly; that Prince of malice is ever filling the hearts of the wicked with malice. It is one of the Devils main plots, to raiſe evil ſurmiſes in wicked mens hearts againſt the godly, and to diſgrace the way of Holineſs as a thing, that tendeth to nothing elſe, but to curb men from their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to be an hook in their Noſtrils. Now as God is Love, ſo Satan is full of malice: and as they that cheriſh in their hearts true Chriſtian Love, and walk in the Spirit of Love, are of God, and do bear his Image; ſo they that do not purge their hearts of Hatred, Malice, and bitterneſs, are of the Devil.</p>

               <p>LEt me now exhort all Chriſtians to love one another. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</hi> Every one that loveth the Children of God unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, is born of God, and is acquainted with him, and knoweth him, as the Child knoweth his Father.</p>
               <p>Were I to ſpeak in an aſſembly of Miniſters, I might in a ſpecial manner direct my ſpeech to them, that they ſhould labour to abound in Brotherly Love, as towards others of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo eſpecially towards each others as Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers, called to the ſame work, and employed to build up the ſame ſpiritual houſe of God, that they ſhould be of one mind, and ſpeak the ſame things, the ſame Truth, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying, nor deſpiſing each other, but rejoycing in each others Gifts and Graces, and in thoſe fruit of each others labours; not like thoſe who grudg to hear of others labours, while themſelves are lazy, and looking on them with an evil eye, refuſing to be their fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and maligning them, becauſe they will not be their fellow-loyterers. What Brotherly love and amity was there among the Apoſtles
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:38435:88"/> of Chriſt? St. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>Paul</hi> his beloved Brother. So when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> returned from the preaching of the Goſpel to divers Nations, we read with what love they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the reſt of the Apoſtles at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.4. And when they were come to Jeruſalem, they were received of the Church, and of the Apoſtles and Elders. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Elders in their Epiſtle ſent to the Churches, ſpeak thus. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 25.26. <hi>It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good unto us being aſſembled together, to ſend cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Saul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Where they both profeſs their entire love unto them, and alſo in Brotherly love give them ſpecial Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:38435:88"/> John</hi> (three eminent Apoſtles) <hi>who ſeemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me, and Barnabas, the right hand of fellow-ſhip. Gal.</hi> 2.9. The reaſon is plain; for as they excelled in admirable gifts, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, ſo they abounded in ſaving-graces, and eſpecially in that grace of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Brotherly love, which purged their hearts from envy and carnal emulation of the gifts or ſucceſs of each other, and ſo they kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Moreover, they knew well, that they were as a City ſet on an Hill, and that the eye of the world was fixed upon them, and therefore they were careful to walk in Love, as towards all ſorts, ſo eſpecially towards each other, that they might not give occaſion to the enemies to blaſpheme, that they might not offend the Church of God, nor blemiſh his Glory. They knew well, that this was needful for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the Goſpel, of that great work of the Apoſtleſhip, to which the Lord had called them, that they ſhould with one mind, and one Spirit, joyn together in the work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This may diſcover to us the intolerable pride of the Pope, who inſtead of embracing the godly Miniſters of Chriſt with Brotherly Love (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth embrace <hi>Paul,</hi> as his Brother and equal) doth firſt lift up himſelf above them; and in a cruel manner tyrannize over them.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:38435:89"/> St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not lift up over the head of <hi>Paul</hi> the ſcepter of Dominion and Papal Supremacy, nor offer him his foot to kiſs, as the Pope, his pretended Succeſſor; but in all Brotherly Love, and in the ſpirit of meekneſs giveth him the right hand of fellowſhip, as to his equal in place and dignity. Therefore when the Pope bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only Miniſters of the Goſpel, but alſo the Kings and Emperors of the world into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and challengeth an uncontroled autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them, we may juſtly ſay, From the beginning it was not ſo; no, nor for many ages after: the Church of God, a long time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging no one ſupream Head, but Chriſt, as is manifeſt by many things which were written many hundred years before <hi>Luther</hi> was born. Therefore all proud papal Spirits, who are more like the Pope in a proud contempt of their Brethren, than they are to <hi>Peter</hi> in Meekneſs and Brotherly Love: they ceaſe to derive their Pedigree from the Apoſtles, until they do more truly expreſs their Graces, and follow their Example.</p>

This to the end of the world is a badg of Chriſts true Diſciples, and this ſheweth, that the ſame mind is in them that was in Chriſt Jeſus, who loved them, and waſhed them with his own blood, to make them Kings and Prieſts unto his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God is Love, and he that loveth in, and for the Lord, is born of God, and beloved of God. And we ſhould labour more and more freely to taſte of the Love of God, that our hearts may be more ſeaſoned with Chriſtian Love towards others.</p>
               <p>How can it ſtand together, that Chriſtians ſhould be led by one Spirit, and yet be ſo croſs and contrary in their affections to each other? Is Chriſt divided, ſaith the Apoſtle? Can the Spirit of Chriſt which is the Spirit of Peace and Love be the cauſe of diviſion in thoſe who are all poſſeſſed with one and the ſame Spirit?

               <p>Now that I may move you to Brotherly Love, I deſire you to conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is an honourable thing for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to love one another. We have a notable example of this Brotherly Love in two Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>viz. Eumenes</hi> and <hi>Attalus.</hi> This <hi>Eumenes</hi> was King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and left his Wife and his Kingdom, and travelled abroad, ſhortly after whoſe departure, news was brought to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that <hi>Eumenes</hi> was cowardly ſlain by one <hi>Perſius,</hi> whereupon <hi>Attalus</hi> taketh his Brothers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and his Wife: not long after <hi>Attalus</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth news of his Brothers Life, and ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. He doth not then (as policy would have done) prepare to keep the Kingdom he had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped, and to hold out his Brother in hoſtile manner at point of ſpear; but he meeteth him with Muſick, as glad of his return, and reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him his Wife and Kingdom. His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having power in his hand again, only ſaid thus in his ear, Thou ſhouldſt not have taken my Wife, unleſs thou hadſt ſeen me dead; and never gave him bitter word afterwards; and dying left him his Kingdom in ample ſort. And
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:38435:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> to requite this favour, his brother dying maketh his Son his heir to his Fathers Kingdom, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had many Sons of his own. This ſingular example of Brotherly Love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe Heathens will be laid to our charge, if we come ſhort of them in this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Love is a very neceſſary thing: Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Love is as neceſſary as Life. As a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live the Life of Nature without breath; ſo neither can he live the Life of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Love. St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>As the body without the ſpirit is dead,</hi> (or the body without breath is dead) <hi>even ſo faith without works is dead alſo:</hi> it is breathleſs and liveleſs without works. Now what are works here ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, but the Acts and Fruits of Chriſtian Love? So then the Soul without Love is dead in ſins, and hath no ſpiritual Breath nor Life.</p>
               <p>It is in vain to ſay, We live unleſs we love; unleſs we have the truth of Chriſtian and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Love, we may think our ſelves to be alive, but indeed are dead.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> notably ſheweth the neceſſity of this Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>Though I ſpeak with the Tongues of men and of Angels, and have not charity</hi> (or Chriſtian Love) <hi>I am become as ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding braſs, or as a tinckling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and all knowledg: And though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:38435:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> not charity, I am nothing. And though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor; and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> So ye ſee that Love is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that all is nothing without it. Though a man where an Angel for gifts and abilities; though he ſhould ſpare neither body nor goods, yet without Chriſtian Love all is nothing; for all theſe without true Love, are but the works of a dead man, ſeparated from God, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life, and deſtitute of the ſpirit of Chriſt, who is the ſpirit of Love and Life. So all gifts and works without Love, are but the dead works of dead men, and therefore nothing in the ſight of God. <hi>If I have not charity, I am nothing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Whatſoever I have elſe, whatſoever I do, I am nothing: I have not the Eſſence and Being of a Chriſtian; my Soul is an empty Carcaſe, Though a man ſhould build Churches, Colledges, Hoſpitals, Alms-houſes: Though he ſhould ſpend his ſtrength in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though he ſhould ſpend his time in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reading, yet he is nothing in the eyes of God; if he have not the Grace of Chriſtian Love, he hath not the Being and Eſſence of a Chriſtian, and of one born of God.</p>
               <p>In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am.</hi> Why? St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not <hi>all grace,</hi> not <hi>all ſpirit,</hi> there was ſomething in him that was of Nature, and ſomething of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38435:91"/> Education, before ever he taſted of the Grace of God: but the Apoſtle counted all this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: his legal righteouſneſs nothing; his learning nothing; his natural abilities; his whole ſelf nothing; only that was his Being, which was newly breathed in him by the work of Gods ſaving Grace and ſanctifying Spirit. This was the only ſomething that he made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, even this new Being and new Nature, which was of the Grace of God. —So when a man hath the Spirit of Love, and power, and of a ſound mind, then he is ſomething; then is he ſomething towards God; then is he one of thoſe that God makes a reckoning of; one of the Lords own number. Ye find <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.4. &amp;c. that there were ſealed of the twelve Tribes of Iſrael twelve thouſand of each Tribe, which made up an hundred forty and fourthou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Theſe (ye ſee) were numbred and ſealed; and theſe followed the Lamb, and ſtood with him upon mount Sion. Now there were abundance of the people of Iſrael beſides theſe; but there was no reckoning made of them; they were not numbred, and ſo not ſealed; they came not into the Lords account; they were nothing; they wanted the grace of Love, and the ſpirit of Life; they wanted the Being and Eſſence of Saints and Children of God. So beloved! a man may be ſomething in the viſible Church, he may have a place and a name among the people of God; yea, he may
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:38435:92"/> be of ſpecial uſe in the Church, and do ſome ſpecial ſervice, yet if he have not the Spirit of Love, which is the Spirit of Life, he is nothing in Gods account: he ſtandeth for a Cyphar; he is none of the Lords number. How neceſſary then is this Grace of Chriſtian Love? It is far more neceſſary to love, than to be beloved. Though a man ſhould be as friendleſs as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in their afflictions, and find as little Love as they did; yet if he himſelf in the mean-time be poſſeſſed with the Spirit of Love, he is a living man, an happy man, a child of God, one born of God, who <hi>is Love.</hi> This grace of Love, whereof his Heart and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beareth him witneſs, ſhall yeeld him more ſweet and ſound Comfort, than all the worlds affection towards him.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, if a man were the worlds Minion, and Darling, and had the Love of a whole Countrey in an high degree; yet if he himſelf have not this grace of true Chriſtian Love, he were nothing: let the world make as much as ſhe can of him, God will make nothing of him; he will not number him, nor write him among the living, his name is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven. Thus ye ſee how neceſſary this grace of Love is. In that place of St. <hi>James</hi> fore-cited, it is ſaid, <hi>Faith without works is dead.</hi> Now how doth Faith work, but by Love? An Handy-crafts-man may as well work at his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38435:92"/> Trade without a hand, as a man may do the works of Faith (works that are witneſſes of a lively, ſaving, Faith) without true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Love. A man may do many things, which for the outſide may look like the works and fruits of Faith without Love; but they want the heart and ſoul, of works acceptable unto God: they are but the outward caſes of good works. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Let all your things be done with Love;</hi> if they be done without Love, they be done without Life; and they cannot be done with Love, unleſs with hearts poſſeſſed with the Spirit of Love.</p>
               <p>How miſerable then ſhould we think our ſelves without Love? Men often complain for w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngs that they complain of the want of, may well be ſpared, and are rather ſuperfluities than neceſſaries: But alas! what is ſo neceſſary as true Chriſtian Love? many think they have enough of it, who yet have not one ſpark of this heavenly fire in their hearts: they think they have love enough to others, but not love e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from others; whereas it is a thing much more to be looked after, that we have fervent and ſincere love towards others, than that we may taſt plentifully of the fruits of Love from others.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:38435:93"/>
               <p>And in deſiring an encreaſe of Love in others, we ſhould rather deſire it for the glory of God, and as a ſeal of their effectual calling, and a means to further their account, whoſe Love we deſire; than to enjoy the fruits of their Love for our own outward benefit, or contentment. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of ſome Chriſtians boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and commending it, ſaith, <hi>Not that I deſire a gift, but I deſire fruit, that may abound to your account.</hi> That is, I deſire your benefit in giving, rather than my own benefit in receiving; and ſo in others fruit of Love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the excellency of this grace of Chriſtian Love: It is a moſt noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent grace, it ſheweth who are of the ſeed Royal, who are the Children of the King of Kings, it diſcovereth who be the Heirs of glory, and belonging to the Kingdom of God. It is (as it were) the heart of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This new Creature hath its ſeveral parts and faculties, as well as the natural man; and Faith is (as it were) the brain of the new man; yet ſo, that it hath an influence upon the heart and active powers of the new Creature. That, bringeth in Light, and apprehendeth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhining graciouſly in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who is the brightneſs of the Fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But Love is the heart of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that which warmeth the new man, and is the firſt mover in the actions of obedience,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38435:93"/> whether of Love and Holineſs toward God, or of Love and Righteouſneſs towards man.</p>
               <p>Now ye know, that the heart is a principal part in any Creature that hath that part; and the more excellent the Creature is, the more excellent is that part of it. Now no Creature under Heaven is comparable for excellency with the new Creature, which is the immediate frame and work of the ſanctifying Spirit, an effect of one of his moſt divine Operations. I mean, the whole frame of Regeneration and Sanctification in one born of God; now Love is the heart of this new Creature: the heart in a man is ſaid to be <hi>primum vivens, et ultimum moriens;</hi> the firſt part that liveth, the laſt that dieth: But Love, which is the heart of the new Creature, never dyeth: Faith and Hope have their periods; Love out-liveth them, and is everlaſting: for <hi>Faith</hi> is of things not ſeen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when all the glorious things promiſed and beleeved, lye open to the ſight of the Saints at a full view; Faith, as <hi>it is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen,</hi> ſhall ceaſe; Hope, is of things to come; but when all ſhall be in preſent poſſeſſion, and the Soul can neither expect nor receive any more, Hope ſhall ceaſe. But Love is for ever and ever; and this ſhall be in full perfection when this Life ſhall end, when there ſhall be nothing in them that love, nor in them that are to be loved, which may hinder Love;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38435:94"/> when they ſhall wholly dwell in God who is Love, and be filled with the fulneſs of God, and ſo with fulneſs of Love. And if he could ſay of his earthly kind of wiſdom, that if it were viſible, and to be ſeen with the eyes of men, it would make men ſtrangely ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with it; how much more may it be ſaid of this Chriſtian Love, which is from above, that if it were in a viſible ſhape, and had an outward beauty, anſwerable to the excellency of its Nature, it would enflame the affections of men and women towards it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Love makes men uſeful and helpful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith of thoſe men that are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and contentious, that they do break the order of nature. For whereas the Philoſophers affirm a man by nature to be <hi>animal politicum,</hi> malicious and contentious perſons make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unfit for ſociety, being no better than firebrands of ſedition, and Satans Inſtruments to ſow diſſention. Therefore St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that all companies are not to be called a people but only thoſe who are joyned by conſent of Laws. And the ſame Father ſaith thus; Give me that <hi>unum neceſſarium,</hi> that one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> Love and Unity, and thou ſhalt have a people well ordered. Take away this, and thou ſhalt have a rout, a confuſion, and all out of order; for where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:38435:94"/> 
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.16. Love is an uniting grace, we read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1. that <hi>the ſoul of Jonathan was knit with the ſoul of David;</hi> the reaſon followeth, <hi>and Jonathan loved him as his own ſoul.</hi> This made him very helpful to <hi>David</hi> upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſets down many good fruits of this grace of Love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Charity ſuffereth l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38435:95"/> is implacable, or inexorable, whatſoever, or how great ſoever the wrongs or injuries be. They that cannot be reconciled, that will not be pacifyed or appeaſed, are far from Chriſtian Love.</p>
               <p>True Chriſtian Love is not barren, it will make men uſe the gifts of ſeveral kinds which God hath given to the ſupply and benefit of the people of God, according to their ſeveral wants. So thoſe of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ſupplied the wants of the Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem. Nehemiah</hi> improved his favour with the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> for the good of the Church of God in <hi>Judea:</hi> So did <hi>Daniel</hi> improve his favour with <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> for the advancement of <hi>Shadrach, Meſech, Abednego:</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> improved his dignity for the benefit of the Church. That Love which is true, will be fruitful; now theſe fruits of Love are of divers kinds, according to the ſeveral parts of the Second Table. As all duties of love towards the Souls of others, in Miniſters, Maſters, Parents, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Acquaintance, &amp;c. preaching the Word, catechizing, inſtructing, admoniſhing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, reproving publickly, privately, in praying for them, &amp;c. And towards their bodies, goods, good names, in relieving their wants, in defending them to our power, in cleering them according to our knowledg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſlaunders, falſe accuſations, &amp;c. and ſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38435:95"/> for all other duties which man oweth to man. Theſe things every Chriſtian muſt practi e and he muſt do them out of the truth of Chriſtian Love. As, that is not true Love, which doth not bring forth ſuch fruits of Love; ſo thoſe works are not accepted, which are not done in Love, though they may be ſuch works (for the matter) as are commanded in the Law of Love.</p>

               <p>LEt us then labour to put in practice that exhortation of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>My little Children let us not love in word and tongue; but in deed and in truth.</hi> Where the Apoſtle doth not condemn profeſſion and expreſſion of Love in words, and with the Tongue, for he himſelf uſed it, I think no man more: yea he uſeth it in that place, expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, <hi>My little children,</hi> &amp;c. So he expreſſeth much Love in words in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle. But he condemneth that ſhew of Love; which is meer words, and a bare profeſſion of Love. A Tree is not to be liked the worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it beareth a fair Leaf together with good fruits, but rather the better; for it is both an
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:38435:96"/> ornament to the Tree, and maketh the fruit the more ſavoury, and of a better reliſh. But this maketh the Tree ready for the Ax and for the Fire, when it beareth Leaves and no Fruit, or little Fruit: ſo a Chriſtian is not to be liked the worſe for cloathing his fruits and works of Love, with expreſſions, profeſſions, and words of Love, but the better rather: for they are both an ornament to him in his Chriſtian courſe, and (beſides) they give grace and reliſh to thoſe works and fruits. Yea, Chriſtian ſpeeches in many caſes are themſelves very good and wholeſom fruits, good arguments of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and very profitable to the hearers, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring grace unto them, and winning them ſo ſome liking of the ways of God: yea, good words of admonition, conſolation, are as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alms, as any other, for many; though not ſo acceptable to the moſt.</p>
               <p>But as a Tree that beareth ſtore of good fruit, though it have but a ragged Leaf, is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than another that is rough, and full of green and fair Leaves, with none, or little fruit; ſo a Chriſtian full of good works, though not fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ſpoken, is far to be preferred above one who hath a fair tongue and a cloſe hand.</p>
               <p>The thing then which the Apoſtle exhorteth unto, is, That we ſhould not reſt in a Love that ſheweth it ſelf only in words and tongue, but that which is in deed and in truth.</p>

               <p>THis ſhould make us in the next place to take heed of thoſe ſins that do eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſtir up the heart to break the bond of Love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of ſuffering Anger to ſettle, and take root in your hearts; cure it while it is but a green wound, before it turn into a Canker or feſtered ſore of malice and hatred; quench it when it is but a ſpark, or when it beginneth to kindle; let not the Sun go down upon thy wrath. Anger engendereth malice, unleſs it be ſuppreſſed. Perſons overcome with anger, the Lord thinketh them unworthy of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſociety, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24. <hi>Make no friendſhip with an angry man, and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go.</hi> God doth not brand any created paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſeated in the Soul of man, as he doth anger. Though all the paſſions ſeated in the ſoul of man (when extream) are vicious, yet God doth no where forbid us to make friendſhip with a man of grief, of fears, of hope, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, of love, but only <hi>with an angry man:</hi> Do not take them ever for Friends and Companions. In another place he ſaith, <hi>Walk not with the froward, for fear of learning his ways, and getting
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38435:97"/> a ſnare unto thy ſoul. Chryſoſtome</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth furious angry men,<note place="margin">Chryſost. Hom. ad. pop. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</note> 
                  <hi>Daemoniacks,</hi> men poſſeſſed with the Devil; for as they rage and blaſpheme, and are ſet upon miſchief, ſo men in their anger are for any miſchief the Devil at that inſtant ſuggeſteth to them: Oh, how prompt and ready are men in their wrath to do what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they can to their Brethren.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of the ſin of Envy, which is a ſin that breaketh the neareſt bond of Nature, and the ſtrongeſt bond of Love. Envy did ſo fret in the heart of moſt of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons, that they decreed the death of <hi>Joſeph</hi> their innocent Brother; and though afterwards they ſpared his life, yet they robbed him of his liberty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to thoſe dangers which were worſe than death, baniſhing him out of the Church, and giving him occaſion to fall from the true God, had not the Lord been gracious to him <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.20.28 Therefore labour by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love to purge out this bitter affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, left it alienate your hearts from your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs. This ſin makes men even to deſire the death of their own Parents, and Brethren, that they may have their lands or goods, and ſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſecret murther in their hearts. This ſin (I fear) is too common, and little laid to heart.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:38435:97"/> But, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that looketh on a woman, and luſteth after her, hath committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her already in his heart.</hi> So may we not ſay? he that looketh on the eſtate, and goods of a Father, Brother, Kinſman, &amp;c. and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for their death, hath committed murther already in his heart. This ſin of Covetouſneſs alſo maketh men to break the bonds of natural affection, when it bringeth them to defraud or wrong thoſe in their goods which are neereſt to them. The prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſheweth how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thoſe times were, which were a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Take ye heed every one of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and truſt ye not in any brother; for every bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will utterly ſupplant, and every neighbour will walk with ſlaunders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. See that Pride root not it ſelf in your hearts: Pride lifteth up the heart in high thoughts of its own worth; it breedeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs to God and men: Pride breedeth ſcorn and contempt of others; it breedeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefulneſs, and will not ſuffer us to ſtoop ſo far, as to ſuffer wrongs, and to overcome evil with good: Pride cannot endure to be reproved or admoniſhed; it breedeth ſelf-will and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs: it will be ſerved before God himſelf; it will ſo carry away a mans heart, that <hi>that</hi> coſt, which ſhould be beſtowed for the glory of God, and the relief of others, ſhall be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:38435:98"/> to ſet forth Pride in ſuperfluitics of apparel, ſumptuous feaſts, buildings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This may teach us <hi>to beware of men,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith: Sin breaketh the Law of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and neereſt relations, it diſſolveth the bond of Brotherhood. A Brother ſeeketh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a Brother: or, if not the ſhedding of his blood, yet his utter undoing. So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not ſafe in reſpect of his Child ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; the Neighbour in reſpect of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. This is not meant for this end, that Towns, Families, Kinreds, &amp;c. ſhould be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with cauſleſs and uncharitable ſuſpicions of one againſt another, whereby Chriſtian Love is weakened or extinguiſhed; but that wiſdom or watchfulneſs ſhould be uſed, eſpecially when men have to do with ſuch, as either are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wicked, or give ſhrewd ſigns of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, that we ſhould not be too open toward ſuch; nor by liberty of ſpeech about matters too high for us to meddle in, or by opening ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to give them power to hurt us; we know not how far the malice of Satan, together with the corruptions of their own hearts may carry them. A wiſe and watchful carriage in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their danger, need not hinder us from performing any office of Chriſtian Love unto them. The Spirit of God in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> giveth many directions of this Nature, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are to practice. And albeit we may think
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:38435:98"/> our words are ſuch, as cannot juſtly be blamed, yet when we uſe unneceſſary liberty of ſpeech, though we ſeem to keep within our bounds, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y may ignorance, miſtake, or malice pervert that which hath been ſpoken, and ſo we may be ſnared in the words of our mouth.</p>
               <p>Nay, not only ſuch as I ſpake of, are to be taken-heed of, but even many others, in whom we ſee not thoſe evidences of notorious ſins, or Hypocriſie; for we know not what alterations there may be in men. It were much to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that our ſpeeches might be ſuch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our ſelves or others might be edified, and not whereby our ſelves or others ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped, or endangered: yea the Scripture that highly condemneth worldlineſs, carking-cares, covetouſneſs, and neglect of that one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet doth commend Chriſtian provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in managing theſe outward things; and therefore it is a Chriſtian duty, and not only a point of good husbandry to take heed of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in betraying our outward means to the will and pleaſure of other men without juſt cauſe, and therefore raſh ſuretyſhip is condemned in Scripture: and many that run into bands they care not how, ſay afterwards (when it is too late) they had thought ſuch and ſuch would never have dealt with them as they have done.</p>

               <p>NOw beloved, ſee that you abound in love to the Brethren; think that you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver love them enough.

               <p>And now my Brethren, when you come to the Table of Lord, and ſee it ſpread and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed before you, I deſire you to take ſpecial notice, that as this Sacrament is a Seal of the Lords unſpeakable love unto us in Chriſt, if we come fitted and prepared for it; ſo it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:38435:99"/> of mutual and brotherly love between thoſe that are the Lords invited gueſts, and thoſe for whom he hath provided this bleſſed Supper. This bread of the Lord is the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread; and this Cup of the Lord is filled for his Children: therefore thou who doſt not love the Children of God, as they are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how canſt thou take this Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Hypocriſie? The Sacrament is a Seal of our Union and Communion with Chriſt and his Saints. So ſaith the Apoſtle concerning this Sacrament; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> Is it not a Seal of our Union and Communion with Chriſt? and ſo proper to thoſe that are truly united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and made one with him.

Now in eating of this one bread with the Children of God, and drinking with them of the ſame Cup, thou profeſſeſt thy ſelf to keep the Unity of the Spirit with them, in the bond of peace, and ſo to embrace them, and to be joyned together with them in love; for they are the people for whom this Supper is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally provided. Now if thou loveſt them the worſe for religion and godlineſs ſake, it is great
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:38435:100"/> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and ſo, a great pollution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thee to receive it; and it is the ready way to bring a Curſe upon thy ſelf, inſtead of a Bleſſing, and to make thee guilty of the blood of Chriſt, inſtead of having thy guilt waſhed away by his blood.</p>

               <p>LEt me now give Arguments to encourage the Godly to ſuffer the Hatred of the World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider what a God ye ſerve, for whoſe ſake ye are hated; and oppoſe the infinite Love of God to the worlds hatred: then you need neither to care for it, nor to be troubled at it. Perhaps a world of wicked men hate thee, yet an infinite God doth love thee: an hell of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are combined againſt thee, yet an infinite God ſtandeth for thee, and embraceth thee. Is the hatred of the world and of hell, greater than the Love of God is towards thee? The worlds hatred is but of a ſhort continuance; Gods Love is an everlaſting Love. There are bounds ſet to the worlds hatred, Gods Love is boundleſs. Look up to God in Heaven, when the world is in an uproar about thee, and quiet thy ſelf with this Meditation. I am cauſleſly hated of the wicked, Yet be not caſt down O my Soul, the Lord of Heaven loveth me; and what is their hatred to His Love? The world is every where railing upon me, and ſcoffing of me; but what are all the reproaches of the world to me as long as the Lord delighteth in me, and approveth of my ways. As <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:38435:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> anſwered <hi>Micohl,</hi> mocking at him, dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ark, It was before the Lord who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in me: he cared not whom he diſpleaſed, ſo long as he pleaſed God; ſo the Saints need not regard the world hatred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath a ſpecial care over thee in thy greateſt dangers and troubles. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, a Saint is, <hi>cura Divini ingenij,</hi> Gods own charge in the world; he hath none to look after, but the Saints. Thou art the Object of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the wicked, and of Gods care, as long as the ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of God are upon thee, what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it that the envious eyes of the wicked be againſt thee? God is more watchful for thy good, than they can be to do thee hurt. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> could ſleep ſecurely in the night, although an H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt of ten thouſand men did encamp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: Gods care over him was an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Shield.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider that you have Chriſt a Co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with you in their hatred. When he lived here, he was hated as much as you can be, and is ſenſible of all the wrongs that are done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. Thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> that are Thorns in thy ſide, are Thorns in his ſide. Thoſe wretches which are pricks in thine Eye, are pricks in the Apple of his Eye. See how comfortably Chriſt ſpeaks to you, <hi>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:38435:101"/>
               <p>The wicked are but ſo many Serpents that have loſt their ſtings; though you fight with a malicious world, yet you contend with a van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed enemy, which ſhall ſhortly be trodden under your feet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God doth over-rule their hatred: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he lets the wicked loſe upon his Saints, ſometimes he binds them up. <hi>Eſau</hi> hated <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and purpoſed to ſlay him, but God chain-him up, and made the face of rough <hi>Eſau</hi> to look like an Angel of God. Wicked men are compared to Seas; ſometimes the Waves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to ſuch an height in a ſtorm, as if they would over throw and drown all before them; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. Conſider, how God will manifeſt his Love to thee in Heaven, who art hated for him here; how Chriſt will hug thee in his arms, and kiſs thee with the kiſſes of his mouth, who art reviled for him here. Caſt up thine eyes to Heaven, when thou art ſenſible of the world; hatred, and ſay, Heaven will pay for

The more marks of Chriſt thou doſt carry about thee, the higher will Chriſt exalt thee. Our Saviour endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, for his eye was fixed upon the glory ſet before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. Set Heaven before thine eyes, and thou wilt neither regard the beſt nor the worſt in this preſent world. Oh what is the hatred of this world to the love of God in Chriſt, and that infinite maſs of glory that ſhall be revealed!</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII.</head>
               <p>FInally let me give two or three rules for a Chriſtians carriages in the time of the worlds hatred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beware of giving juſt cauſe by thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to wicked men, to exaſperate their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt thee: if they hate thee, let it be for Chriſt, for Righteouſneſs ſake, and for well-doing. You are not hated for Chriſt, if you give any cauſe to the Adverſaries of Religion to revile you. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 11.12. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fleſhly luſts that war againſt the ſoul, having your converſation honeſt among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that whereas they ſpeak againſt you as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-doers, they may by their good works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> And 1 Pet. 3.14. <hi>If ye ſuffer for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake, happy are ye, and be not afraid of their terrour, neither be troubled, but ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy always to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you with meekneſs and fear; having a good conſcience, that whereas they ſpeak evil of you as of evil
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:38435:103"/> doers, they may be aſhamed that falſly accuſe your good converſation in Chriſt.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould labour ſo to walk, that they may have nothing to cover their malice withall; but that it may be manifeſt to their Conſciences, and to the eyes of others, that they hate them, and ſet themſelves againſt them for Righteouſneſs-ſake, and that their Adverſaries may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed. Then are men brought to ſhame, when things that are ſhameful are laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; but when Chriſtians by worldlineſs, or diſtempers, or by playing the buſy body, &amp;c. do give them ſomething to cover their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt them withall, they keep them from being aſhamed. But when a Chriſtian walketh unblameably and watchfully, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the ſhame of their malice againſt him, making it to appear, that it is for Righteouſneſs-ſake; and ſo cauſeth the ſhame of it to reflect upon their own faces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that many times their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do condemn them them, for ſuch as fight againſt God, which may be a means of their Converſion or reſtraint.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Carry your ſelves meekly towards them, when they are moſt maliciouſly and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bent againſt you. Two Angels coming into the ſtreets of <hi>Sodom</hi> in the Evening,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:38435:103"/> were entertained by <hi>Lot.</hi> And in likelihood they appeared in the form of men, ſhewed themſelves in a ſhape ſurpaſſing in Beauty, whereupon theſe wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi> boiling with filthy and unnaturall luſt, deſired to abuſe them, contrary to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, taking them to be mortal men; and obſerving into what houſe they ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red between Supper and Bed-time, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted his houſe, and called upon him to bring forth his gueſts, that they might deal with them according to their filthy Luſt. Now mark the carriage of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> in this caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.6, 7, 8. <hi>And Lot went out at the door unto them, and ſhut the door after him, and ſaid, I pray you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do not ſo wickedly: Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But this was partly out of want of Knowledg, as it ſeemeth; for then many Truths were not ſo cleared as now they are: partly it was out of weakneſs: the unlawfulneſs of <hi>Polygamy,</hi> and ſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of doing evil that good might come, or yeelding to ſome ſin to prevent a greater ſin (as in this caſe).

                  </gap>y opened to the godly (it ſeemeth as now) they are, partly it was out of weakneſs of Faith, that he did not reſt upon God, who had ways enough to keep him out of ſo great a ſtrait without any ſuch indirect and unlawful means as appeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: and partly out of a ſudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed haſte, being beſet with a mighty number of men, deſperately wicked, and enflamed with violent and raging luſt, ſo that not having time to retire his thoughts, and compoſe his Spirit, and to take things better into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, he ſell upon this unwarrantable ſhift. I am perſwaded, he had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have loſt his heart-blood, if that would have ſatisfied them; but he thought nothing would ſave his gueſts, unleſs theſe wretches filthy luſts had ſome other Objects to feed upon.</p>

               <p>NOw (to conduct) let me exhort every Chriſtian to maintain a watchful eye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Love, that it wax not cold in theſe evil-times. Our Saviour long ſince propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the latter times, that <hi>becauſe iniquity ſhall abound, the love of many ſhall wax cold, Mat.</hi> 24.12. That there ſhould be a flood of iniquity, and a froſt of love. The times wherein we live, tell us, that iniquity doth abound, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid, it cannot abound more; now then <hi>let brotherly love continaee, Heb.</hi> 13.1. This Love (like that Fire under the Law) came down from Heaven, therefore preſerve it; we had need be very careful, for ſinful times are coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling times: Sin is as apt to quench Love, as Water to quench the Fire. Theſe objects of Love are continually the ſame: When Love goes away, the power, the zeal, the practice of religion goes away. It is an argument your Love is truly divine, if you keep it flaming in the worſt of times. It you ſuffer your Love to God and his people to decay, you will loſe all the good that ever you have done. If your Love decay, all the people of God with whom you have taken ſweet counſel together, prayed together, faſted together, all theſe ſhall riſe up
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38435:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> in judgment againſt you. Oh think what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of damnation yours will be; ye ſhall feel the moſt dreadful effects of Gods eternal hatred, who have ſuffered your Love to Gods ways and people to dye within you. Oh if your Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, it is not eaſily recovered again; and to recover your firſt Love, you muſt repent, and do your firſt works, it will coſt you much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, much ſighing, much ſorrow of heart before you can recover your former degrees of Love. Take heed of a ſlaviſh fear of wicked men; St. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth the ſpirit of fear to the ſpirit of Love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. Be not too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with thoſe that are unſetled in the truth. Many had loved more, had they diſputed leſs. Set your hearts on the things of the world; <hi>Demas</hi> forſook the fellowſhip of the Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he embraced this preſent world.</p>
